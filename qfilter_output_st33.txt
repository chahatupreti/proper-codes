Found 'transporter' in '!Series_summary	"We previously observed that formation of aorta and innominate artery atherosclerotic lesions in the intima of hyperlipidemic apoE-deficient mice but not wild-type mice was accompanied by a marked age-dependent adventitial T cell infiltration. As the mice aged, adventitial T cells formed T/T cell-, T/B cell-, and T/B/dendritic cell aggregates adjacent to atherosclerotic lesions. Some of the adventitial infiltrates formed large clusters of various immune cells including T cells, B cells (centrocytes, follicular mantle cells), dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, and plasma cells with preferential formation in the suprarenal portion of the abdominal aorta. These data demonstrated that the immune lineage cell composition of atherosclerotic lesions and adventitia were distinct: The macrophage-foam cell-, T cell-, and SMC-dominated cell composition of atherosclerosis lesions versus the presence of immune cells capable of carrying out antigen-dependent T cell-driven humoral immune responses in the adventitia also indicated that immune reactions carried out in lesions or the adventitia are fundamentaly different. To distinguish between immunity-regulating genes in atherosclerosis lesions versus the adventitia, a combination of microarray profiling and laser capture microdissection was used. Stringent filters revealed 1163 differentially up-regulated probesets in apoE-/- mouse aortae at 78 weeks (w) versus 6 w. A fuzzy c-means cluster algorythm identified 2 clusters that significantly differed in their slope angles between time points: An apparent atherosclerosis cluster consisted of 771 probesets and an apparent adventitia cluster consisted of 392 probesets. Up-regulated genes at 32 w mirrored the influx of monocyte/macrophages into intima lesions whereas genes up-regulated between 32-78 w mirrored adventitial inflammation. To segregate both clusters into separate gene ontology (GO) molecular function groups, we determined statistically significant up-regulation (unpaired Student t-test; p < 0.05) between 6-32 w for the atherosclerosis cluster and between 32-78 w for the adventitia cluster. Among others, GO molecular function terms cytokine activity, cytokine binding, and immunoglobulin binding in the atherosclerosis cluster and cytokine activity, chemokine receptor activity, and antigen binding in the ATLO cluster suggested candidate genes in relation to inflammation triggered by macrophages or adventitia infiltration, respectively. Among other prototype atherosclerosis genes such as Itgax (complement receptor 4), Cd68, Lysz (lysozyme), Vcam1, and Icam1, the atherosclerosis cluster showed markedly overrepresented prototype macrophage/foam cell genes regulating inflammation in cytokine activity (GO: 0005125): Spp1 (osteopontin) and Il6; in cytokine binding (GO: 0019955) Cd74, Il10rb, Ccr2, and Ccr5; and in immunoglobulin binding (GO: 00119865) the proinflammatory galactose-binding lectin Lgals3, as well as genes in scavenger receptor activity and lipid transporter activity. By contrast, the adventitia cluster showed overrepresented genes regulating B cell recruitment, B cell maturation, germinal center formation, and autoimmunity in cytokine activity including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, in CXC chemokine receptor activity the secondary lymphoid organ counterreceptor of CXCL13 Blr1 (also known as Cxcr5), Cxcr3, and Cxcr6; and in antigen binding several histocompatibility-2 loci and various markedly expressed immunoglobulin genes. As embryonic lymph node development and tertiary lymphoid organ neogenesis share common features signal intensities of genes specifying the GO molecular function term lymph node development (GO: 0048535) were examined in arrays prepared from wild-type and apoE-/- aortae. These results showed that Id2, Nfkb1, and Ltbr were constitutively expressed at significant levels in aortae of both mouse genotypes whereas other genes including Lta, Ltb, Glycam1, and the two lymphorganogenic genes Cxcl13 and Ccl21 were induced at 78 w in apoE-deficient aortae only. Thus, genes expressed by macrophage-foam cells and genes regulating ATLO neogenesis, embryonic lymph node development, or B cell maturation were constitutively expressed in the arterial wall in both genotypes or emerged in a stepwise fashion at 32 w and 78 w. To verify microarray signal intensity data, separate aortae extracts were examined by quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) analyses of wild-type and apoE-deficient mice at 32 and 78 w. These data showed that array signal values accurately reflected gene transcripts. Cell lineage analyses of the adventitial infiltrate and kinetic aorta microarray- and QRT-PCR analyses thus provided circumstantial evidence that immune responses in atherosclerosis intima lesions and the adventitia were distinct. To examine this possibility further, we selected areas of the abdominal aorta burdened with advanced lesions and separated lesions and corresponding adventitial infiltrates of 78 w old apoE-deficient mice by laser dissection microscopy. In addition, adventitiae of aorta segments that were not associated with adjacent lesions and adventitiae of wild-type mice were prepared. Consistent with the lack of a major adventitial leukocyte infiltration, wild-type adventitiae showed gene expression levels that were similar to lesion-free adventitiae of apoE-deficient mice indicating that atherosclerotic lesions directly affected adventitial inflammation in a segmental fashion. Stringent filter criteria identified genes that were differentially expressed in adventitiae and atherosclerotic lesions. Statistical analyses of overrepresented genes in GO molecular function or biological process groups were particularly instructive in cytokine activity, cytokine binding, antigen processing and presentation as well as in lymph node development. Thus, adventitiae in aorta segments with associated atherosclerotic lesions in cytokine activity showed overrepresentation of genes known to be associated with tertiary lymphoid organ formation including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, whereas atherosclerotic lesions showed overrepresentation of prototype atherosclerosis-associated genes Ssp1 (osteopontin), Bmp4 (bone morphogenic protein 4), and Cxc3cl1 (fractalkine); in cytokine binding adventitiae showed overrepresentation of receptors implicated in B cell immunity and autoimmunity including Brl1 (counterreceptor for CXCL13), Ccr7, Tnfrsf4, and Cxcr3 whereas lesions showed overrepresentation of inflammatory mediator receptors including Tnfrs1b, Tgfbr1, and Il7r; moreover, in antigen processing and presentation, adventitiae showed overrepresentation of several histocompatibility loci; additional adventitial gene expression overrepresentations were observed in lymph node development (Fas, SpiB, Ltb, Flt3) whereas lesions showed expression of prototype macrophage genes including Tlr4, Tgfb1, and Tgfb2.  These data provide comprehensive topographical transcriptome information in adventitial tissue adjacent to atherosclerotic lesions versus lesions and are expected to form the basis for future cell lineage expression analyses using single cell detection methodology including ISH."'

Found 'SMRT' in '!Series_summary	"The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) has been proposed to regulate target genes in the absence of triiodothyronine (T3), through the recruitment of the corepressors, NCoR and SMRT. NCoR and SMRT may thus play a key role in both hypothyroidism and resistance to thyroid hormone, though this has never been tested in vivo. To accomplish this we developed mice that express in the liver a NCoR protein (L-NCoR∆ID) that cannot interact with the TR. L-NCoR∆ID mice develop normally, however when made hypothyroid the repression of many positively regulated T3-target genes is abrogated, demonstrating that NCoR plays a specific and sufficient role in repression by the unliganded TR. Remarkably, in the euthyroid state, expression of many T3-targets are also upregulated in L-NCoR∆ID mice, demonstrating that NCoR also determines the magnitude of the response to T3 in euthyroid animals. While positive T3 targets were upregulated in L-NCoR∆ID mice in the hypo and euthyroid state there was less effect seen on negatively regulated T3 target genes. Thus, NCoR is a specific regulator of T3-action in vivo and mediates the activity of the unliganded TR. Furthermore, NCoR may play a key role in determining the differences in individual responses to similar levels of circulating T3."'

Genes such as CaV1.2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, repressed by TNFalpha, were induced by anti-TNF treatment.  Further, we showed that chronic TNFalpha exposure impaired NF-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation activity, leading to T cell unresponsiveness.

The goal of this study is to analyze global transcriptional alterations resulting from TNFalpha treatment on TCR signaling pathways using cDNA microarrays.  We found that genes involved in functional categories including T cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, ubiquitination, cytokine synthesis, calcium signaling, and apoptosis were modulated.  Genes such as ubiquitin family genes, cytokine inducible SH2-containing genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p57, calmodulin family genes (calmodulin -V1, -V2, and ?V3) and calcium channel voltage- dependent, N type alpha1B subunit (CaV2.2) were induced by TNFalpha, while Vav2, Rho GTPase activating protein, calcium channel voltage dependent, L type alpha 1C subunit (CaV1.2), interleukin-1 (IL) receptor-associated kinase 1, and -V2 (IRAK-1and -2) and IL enhancer binding factor 3 were reduced by TNFalpha.  Genes such as CaV1.2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, repressed by TNFalpha, were induced by anti-TNF treatment.  Further, we showed that chronic TNFalpha exposure impaired NF-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation activity, leading to T cell unresponsiveness.  Thus, our results present a detailed picture of transcriptional programs affected by chronic TNFalpha exposure, and provide candidate target genes, which may function to mediate TNFalpha induced T cell unresponsiveness."'

Found 'myeloid leukemia' in '!Series_summary	"Nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) prototype is a family of mammalian histone methyltransferases (NSD1, NSD2/MMSET/WHSC1, NSD3/WHSC1L1) that are essential in development and are mutated in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), overgrowth syndromes, multiple myeloma and lung cancers. In AML, the recurring t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) translocation fuses NSD1 to nucleoporin-98 (NUP98). Here, we present the first characterization of the transforming properties and molecular mechanisms of NUP98-NSD1. We demonstrate that NUP98-NSD1 induces AML in vivo, sustains self-renewal of myeloid stem cells in vitro, and enforces expression of the HoxA7, HoxA9, HoxA10 and Meis1 proto-oncogenes. Mechanistically, NUP98-NSD1 binds genomic elements adjacent to HoxA7 and HoxA9, maintains histone H3 Lys 36 (H3K36) methylation and histone acetylation, and prevents EZH2-mediated transcriptional repression of the Hox-A locus during differentiation. Deletion of the NUP98 FG-repeat domain, or mutations in NSD1 that inactivate the H3K36 methyltransferase activity or that prevent binding of NUP98-NSD1 to the Hox-A locus precluded both Hox-A gene activation and myeloid progenitor immortalization. We propose that NUP98-NSD1 prevents EZH2-mediated repression of Hox-A locus genes by colocalizing H3K36 methylation and histone acetylation at regulatory DNA elements. This report is the first to link deregulated H3K36 methylation to tumorigenesis and to link NSD1 to transcriptional regulation of the Hox-A locus."'

Found 'Ahr' in '!Series_summary	"Conventional biochemical and molecular techniques identified previously several genes whose expression is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We sought to map the complete spectrum of AHR-dependent genes in male adult liver using expression arrays to contrast mRNA profiles in Ahr-null mice (Ahr–/–) with those in mice with wild-type AHR (Ahr+/+). Transcript profiles were determined both in untreated mice and in mice treated 19 h earlier with 1000 µg/kg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Expression of 456 ProbeSets was significantly altered by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner, including members of the classic AHRE-I gene battery, such as Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, and Nqo1. In the absence of exogenous ligand, AHR status alone affected expression of 392 ProbeSets, suggesting that the AHR has multiple functions in normal physiology. In Ahr–/– mice, only 32 ProbeSets exhibited responses to TCDD, indicating that the AHR is required for virtually all transcriptional responses to dioxin exposure in liver. The flavin-containing monooxygenases, Fmo2 and Fmo3, considered previously to be uninducible, were highly induced by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner. The estrogen receptor alpha as well as two estrogen-receptor-related genes (alpha and gamma) exhibit AHR-dependent expression, thereby extending cross-talk opportunities between the intensively studied AHR and estrogen receptor pathways. p53 binding sites are over-represented in genes down-regulated by TCDD, suggesting that TCDD inhibits p53 transcriptional activity. Overall, our study identifies a wide range of genes that depend on the AHR, either for constitutive expression or for response to TCDD."'

We observed alterations in gene expression consistent with a physiological response of melan-Ink4a-b cells to endoplasmic reticulum protein-folding impairment. Additionally, a set of loci was identified that are expressed in a similar manner to known melanocyte genes. Importantly, the collection of 254 genes is enriched for expression in the multiple melanocyte lines relative to control cell populations. This set contains Tyr, Tyrp1, Dct, Si, Melna, Slc24a5, Slc45a2, Slc24a4, Mitf, and Sox10, in addition to genes not previously attributed to pigmentation and genes with unknown function. Further evaluation of one gene in this cohort, Gpnmb, demonstrated an expression pattern similar to Dct, Si and Mitf. This expression is vastly reduced in MitfMi mutants embryos, indicating that it is dependent on Mitf for in vivo expression. Consistent with this notion, a highly-conserved MITF binding site resides directly upstream of human GPNMB, and deletion of this sequence dramatically reduces in vitro enhancer activity."'

Found 'Rad23a' in '!Series_summary	"A relationship exists between nuclear architecture and gene activity and it has been proposed that the activity of ongoing RNA polymerase II transcription determines genome organization in the mammalian cell nucleus. Recently developed 3C and 4C technology allowed us to test the importance of transcription for nuclear architecture. We demonstrate that upon transcription inhibition binding of RNA polymerase II to gene regulatory elements is severely reduced. However, contacts between regulatory DNA elements and genes in the β-globin locus are unaffected and the locus still interacts with the same genomic regions elsewhere on the chromosome. This is a general phenomenon since the great majority of intra- and interchromosomal interactions with the ubiquitously expressed Rad23a gene are also not affected. Our data demonstrate that without transcription the organization and modification of nucleosomes at active loci and the local binding of specific trans-acting factors is unaltered. We propose that these parameters, more than transcription or RNA polymerase II binding, determine the maintenance of long-range DNA interactions. "'

Found 'Ig' in '!Series_summary	"Nuclear compartmentalization appears to play an important role in regulating metazoan genes. While studies on immunoglobulin (Ig) and other loci have correlated positioning at the nuclear lamina with gene repression, the functional consequences of this compartmentalization remain untested. We devised an approach for inducible tethering of genes to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and demonstrate with 3D DNA-ImmunoFISH, repositioning of chromosomal regions to the nuclear lamina. Relocalization requires mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown and reformation. Tethering leads to the accumulation of lamin and INM proteins but not to association with pericentromeric heterochromatin or nuclear pore complexes. Recruitment of genes to the INM can result in their transcriptional repression. Using DamID we show that as is the case for our model system, inactive Ig loci at the nuclear periphery are contacted by INM and lamina components. We propose that such molecular interactions are used to compartmentalize and limit the accessibility of Ig loci."'

We therefore broadly characterized gene expression in skeletal muscle of three independently generated mouse models of this disorder. The mouse models included a polyglutamine expanded (polyQ) AR knock-in model (AR113Q KI), a polyQ AR transgenic model (AR97Q Tg), and a transgenic mouse which overexpresses wild type AR solely in muscle (HSA-AR Tg). We performed microarray analysis of lower hindlimb muscles taken from these three models using high density oligonucleotide arrays. Changes in gene expression relative to wild type controls were evaluated separately in each strain. We validated our results using quantitative RT-PCR. Patterns of gene expression that are common to all lines and unique to each are described.  When considered globally, the degree of overlap between the three models is approximately equivalent, and several patterns of gene expression relevant to the disease process were observed. Notably, patterns of gene expression typical of loss of AR function were observed in all three models, as were alterations in genes involved in cell adhesion, energy balance, Huntington’s disease, muscle atrophy and myogenesis. By comparing patterns of gene expression in three independent models of KD/SBMA, we have been able to identify candidate genes that might mediate the core myogenic features of KD/SBMA."'

This activation causes bone loss in animals and humans, at least in part due to suppression of osteoblast differentiation from marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). In order to identify mechanisms by which PPARg2 suppresses osteoblastogenesis and promotes adipogenesis in MSC, we have analyzed the PPARg2 transcriptome in response to Rosi. A total of 4,252 transcriptional changes resulted when Rosi (1 uM) was applied to the U-33 marrow stromal cell line, stably transfected with PPARg2 (U-33/g2), as compared to non-induced U-33/g2 cells. Differences between U-33/g2 and U-33 cells stably transfected with empty vector (U-33/c) comprised 7,928 transcriptional changes, independent of Rosi. Cell type-, time- and treatment-specific gene clustering uncovered distinct patterns of PPARg2 transcriptional control of MSC lineage commitment. The earliest changes accompanying Rosi activation of PPARg2 included adjustments in morphogenesis, Wnt signaling, and immune responses, as well as sustained induction of lipid metabolism. Expression signatures influenced by longer exposure to Rosi provided evidence for distinct mechanisms governing the repression of osteogenesis and stimulation of adipogenesis. Our results suggest interactions that could lead to the identification of a “master” regulatory scheme controlling osteoblast differentiation. "'

Found 'HD' in '!Series_summary	"Achieving a mechanistic understanding of disease and initiating preclinical therapeutic trials necessitate the study of huntingtin toxicity and its remedy in model systems. To allow the engagement of appropriate experimental paradigms, Huntington’s disease (HD) models need to be validated in terms of how they recapitulate a particular aspect of human disease. In order to examine transcriptome-related effects of mutant huntingtin, we compared striatal mRNA profiles from seven genetic mouse models of disease to that of postmortem human HD caudate using microarray analysis. Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in models of HD took longer to appear, 15-month and 22-month CHL2Q150/Q150, 18-month HdhQ92/Q92 and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. When the affected genes were compared across models, a robust concordance was observed. Importantly, changes concordant across multiple lines mice were also in excellent agreement with the mRNA changes seen in human HD caudate. Although it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared to those caused by expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. There was, however, an overall concordance between transcriptomic signature and disease stage. We thus conclude that the transcriptional changes of HD can be modelled in several available lines of transgenic mice, comprising lines expressing both N-terminal and full-length mutant huntingtin proteins. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides an important chronology of mutant huntingtin's gene expression effects."'

However, only the memory precursors were capable of making IL-2 thus defining a novel effector cell that was cytotoxic, expressed granzyme B, and produced inflammatory cytokines in addition to IL-2. This effector population then differentiated into long-lived protective memory T cells capable of self-renewal and rapid re-call responses. Mechanistic studies showed that cells that continued to receive antigenic stimulation during the later stages of infection were more likely to become terminal effectors. Importantly, curtailing antigenic stimulation towards the tail-end of the acute infection enhanced the generation of memory cells. These studies support the decreasing potential model of memory differentiation and show that the duration of antigenic stimulation is a critical regulator of memory formation"'

Found 'Ad' in '!Series_summary	"Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes that modify key residues in histones to regulate chromatin architecture, and play a vital role in cell survival, cell cycle progression, and tumorigenesis. To understand the function of Hdac3, a critical component of the N-CoR/SMRT repression complex, a conditional allele of Hdac3 was engineered. Given the vital role of HDAC3 in normal cells and in the generation and treatment of various cancers, a conditional deletion of Hdac3 was engineered in mice. The deletion of Hdac3 in the germ line yielded very early embryonic lethality. Therefore, mouse embryonic-derived fibroblasts (MEFs) containing the Hdac3 conditional allele were used to examine the function of Hdac3 in cell viability and in cell cycle control. Given the links between Hdac3 and transcriptional repression, we used oligonucleotide micro arrays to examine RNA isolated from control and Cre recombinase expressing MEFs to define the changes in gene expression upon inactivation of Hdac3.  Initially, we compared RNA from Ad-Cre infected Hdac3FL/+ and Hdac3FL/- MEFs and then we extended the analysis to Hdac3FL/- MEFs expressing Cre-ER (tamoxifen responsive Cre-estrogen receptor fusion protein).  When the gene expression of ethanol-treated (vehicle) and tamoxifen-treated MEFs was compared at 72 hr post-induction, 83 genes were induced and 111 genes were down-regulated at least 1.5-fold upon inactivation of Hdac3.  Approximately, 48 genes were up-regulated in both Ad-Cre and tamoxifen-treated MEFs at the 72 hr time point.  The majority of the affected genes were associated with signal transduction and metabolism. Overall, few of the up-regulated genes at the 72hr time point in Ad-Cre and tamoxifen-treated MEFs are associated with apoptosis or with cell cycle control. Thus, these metabolic regulatory genes may be “core” Hdac3-regulated genes, and alterations in gene expression are unlikely to trigger apoptosis. "'

B lineage cells lacking the related transcription factors IRF-4 and IRF-8 undergo a developmental arrest at the cycling pre-B cell stage and are blocked for light-chain recombination. Using Irf-4,8-/- pre-B cells we demonstrate that two pathways converge to synergistically drive light-chain rearrangement, a process that is not simply activated by cell cycle exit. One pathway is directly dependent on IRF-4, whose expression is elevated by pre-BCR signaling.  IRF-4 targets the κ 3′ and λ enhancers to increase locus accessibility and positions a kappa allele away from pericentromeric heterochromatin. The other pathway is triggered by attenuation of IL-7 signaling and results in activation of the κ intronic enhancer via binding of the transcription factor, E2A. Intriguingly, IRF-4 regulates the expression of CXCR4 and promotes the migration of pre-B cells in response to the chemokine CXCL12. We propose that IRF-4 coordinates the two pathways regulating light-chain recombination by positioning pre-B cells away from IL-7 expressing stromal cells."'

Microarray analysis revealed that leptin stimulated some genes associated with cell motility, such as Stmn1.  In addition, leptin appeared to inhibit changes in gene expression associated with terminal differentiation of trophoblast giant cells, including inhibition of members of the TGFß signaling pathway and of genes associated with endoreduplication.

When catecholamine-deficient [tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) null] mouse fetuses die at E13.5-E14.5, they resemble wild type fetuses exposed to hypoxia. They exhibit bradycardia (28% reduction in heart rate), thin ventricular myocardium (20% reduction in tissue), epicardial detachment, and death with vascular congestion, hemorrhage and edema. At E12.5, prior to the appearance of morphological deficits associated with Th deletion, catecholamine-deficient fetuses are preferentially killed by experimentally-induced hypoxia and have lower tissue pO2 than wild type siblings.  Catecholamine-deficient fetuses also induced HIF-1 target genes to a greater extent than wild type siblings, supporting the notion that null fetuses experience greater hypoxia or have an enhanced response to hypoxia. Hypoxia induces a 13-fold increase in plasma norepinephrine levels, which would be expected to increase heart rate, thereby, improving oxygen delivery in wild type mice. Surprisingly, increasing maternal oxygen (FiO2 33% or 63%) prevents the effects of catecholamine-deficiency, restoring heart rate, myocardial mass and survival of Th null fetuses.  We suggest that norepinephrine mediates fetal survival by maintaining oxygen homeostasis as vulnerability to constitutive hypoxia increases as fetal growth accelerates during normal development."'

Found 'interleukin-6' in '!Series_summary	"With advances in supportive therapy in the last two decades, mortality rates from ALI/ARDS have improved somewhat, but remain around 30 to 40% with significant morbidity in survivors. Several promising treatments are in various stages of evaluation, but many have failed to prove beneficial in large randomized clinical trials (RCT). The first definitive step forward in ALI therapeutics occurred recently as a result of a large RCT demonstrating a mortality decrease from 40 to 31% with the use of low-volume ventilation strategies. From this, it is clear that the opportunity for successful intervention in ALI exists. However, therapeutic advances remain frustrated by the lack of complete understanding of ALI pathophysiology. This stresses the importance of integrating basic and clinical research of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. The conclusions of a recent National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Working Group on ALI support this type of research as a priority for future investigations of ALI. One of the areas of research given priority by this ALI Working Group is the issue of ALI severity progression and the role of cells of innate immunity in this process. Currently, the processes that determine which ALI patients progress to ARDS and which do not are unclear. As with many phenotype differences, there is most likely a genetic component involved. The basis for this has been demonstrated. For example, a surfactant protein B (SP-B) polymorphism appears to increase a patient’s risk of developing ALI from pneumonia. Additionally, a polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene for interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been associated with a poor prognosis in patients with ARDS. Understanding the intracellular processes of these genes and the cells expressing them in ALI progression could lead to the identification of molecular markers of ALI severity and eventually to the development of targeted therapies. An examination of genetically uniform animals will provide a clearer insight into the interaction between immune cells in ALI progression as well as guide future human experiments."'

Demonstrating the sufficiency of miR-155 to drive GM expansion, enforced expression in mouse bone marrow cells caused GM proliferation in a manner reminiscent of LPS treatment. However, the mir-155-induced GM populations displayed pathological features characteristic of myeloid neoplasia. Extending possible relevance to human disease, miR-155 was overexpressed in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, miR-155 repressed a subset of genes implicated in hematopoietic development and disease. These data implicate miR-155 as a contributor to physiological GM expansion during inflammation and to certain pathological features associated with AML, emphasizing the importance of proper miR-155 regulation in developing myeloid cells during times of inflammatory stress."'

Found 'pro' in '!Series_summary	"Oxidative stress is pathogenic in neurological diseases including stroke. The identity of oxidative stress-inducible transcription factors and their role(s) in propagating the death cascade are poorly understood. Microarray analysis of neurons undergoing oxidative stress showed significant induction of prodeath genes. These genes have been shown to be regulated by the bZip transcription factor, ATF4. ATF4 protein localized to the promoter of a putative death gene in neurons in vitro and in vivo. Germline deletion of ATF4 in neurons resulted in a reduction in oxidative stress-induced gene expression and resistance to oxidative death. ATF4 knockout mice experienced significantly smaller infarcts and improved behavioral recovery as compared to wild-type mice subjected to the same reductions in blood flow in a rodent model of stroke. ATF4 modulates an early, upstream event in the death pathway, as resistance to oxidative death by ATF4 deletion was associated with decreased consumption of  the antioxidant glutathione. Restoration of ATF4 protein in knockout neurons was sufficient to restore sensitivity to oxidative death and to reaccelerate loss of glutathione. Together, these findings establish ATF4 as a redox-regulated, pro-death transcriptional activator in the nervous system that propagates death responses to oxidative stress in vitro and to stroke in vivo."'

Recent studies demonstrate that mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 is important in PcG mediated silencing with the core PRC1 component Ring1A/B functioning as the E3 ligase8.  PRC2 has been shown to share target genes with the core transcription network to maintain embryonic stem (ES) cells including Oct4 and Nanog. Here we identify an essential role for PRC1 in repressing developmental regulators in ES cells, and thereby in maintaining ES cell pluripotency. A significant proportion of the PRC1 target genes are also repressed by Oct4.  We demonstrate that engagement of PRC1 and PRC2 at target genes is Oct4-dependent and moreover that Ring1B interacts with Oct4. Collectively these results show that PcG complexes are instrumental in Oct4-dependent repression required to maintain pluripotency of ES cells.

A significant proportion of the PRC1 target genes are also repressed by Oct4.  We demonstrate that engagement of PRC1 and PRC2 at target genes is Oct4-dependent and moreover that Ring1B interacts with Oct4. Collectively these results show that PcG complexes are instrumental in Oct4-dependent repression required to maintain pluripotency of ES cells. This study provides a first functional link between a core ES cell regulator and global epigenetic regulation of the genome."'

We determined global changes in gene expression elicited by serotype Typhimurium in the cecal mucosa. The gene expression profile was dominated by T cell derived cytokines and genes whose expression is known to be induced by these cytokines. Markedly increased mRNA levels of interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-22 (IL-22) and IL-17 were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, mRNA levels of genes whose expression is induced by IFN-gamma, IL-22 or IL-17, including macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2), lipocalin-2, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC), were also markedly increased. To assess the importance of T cells in orchestrating this pro-inflammatory gene expression profile, we depleted T cells using a monoclonal antibody prior to investigating cecal inflammation caused by serotype Typhimurium in streptomycin pre-treated mice. Depletion of CD3+ T cells resulted in a dramatic reduction in gross pathology, a significantly reduced recruitment of neutrophils and a marked reduction in mRNA levels of IFN-gamma, IL-22, IL-17, iNOS, lipocalin-2 and KC. Our results suggest that T cells play an important role in amplifying inflammatory responses induced by serotype Typhimurium in the cecal mucosa."'

Found 'HL-1' in '!Series_summary	"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive arrhythmia for which current therapy is inadequate. During AF, rapid stimulation causes atrial remodeling that promotes further AF. The cellular signals that trigger this process remain poorly understood, however, and elucidation of these factors would likely identify new therapeutic targets. We have previously shown that immortalized mouse atrial (HL-1) myocytes subjected to 24 hr of rapid stimulation in culture undergo remodeling similar to that seen in animal models of atrial tachycardia (AT) and human AF. This preparation is devoid of confounding in vivo variables that can modulate gene expression (e.g., hemodynamics). Therefore, we investigated the transcriptional profile associated with early atrial cell remodeling. RNA was harvested from HL-1 cells cultured for 24 hr in the absence and presence of rapid stimulation and subjected to microarray analysis. Data were normalized using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA), and genes exhibiting significant differential expression were identified using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) method. Using this approach, 919 genes were identified that were significantly altered with rapid stimulation (763 up-regulated and 156 down-regulated). For many individual transcripts, changes typical of AF/AT were observed, with marked up-regulation of genes encoding BNP and ANP precursors, heat shock proteins, and MAP kinases, while novel signaling pathways and molecules were also identified. Both stress and survival response were evident, as well as up-regulation of multiple transcription factors. Genes were also functionally classified based on cellular component, biologic process, and molecular function using the Gene Ontology database to permit direct comparison of our data with other gene sets regulated in human AF and experimental AT. For broad categories of genes grouped by functional classification, there was striking conservation between rapidly stimulated HL-1 cells and AF/AT. Results were confirmed using real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 13 genes selected by physiological relevance in AF/AT and regulation in the microarray analysis (up, down, and nonregulated). Rapidly-stimulated atrial myocytes provide a complementary experimental paradigm to explore the initial cellular signals in AT remodeling to identify novel targets in the treatment of AF."'

Found 'fatty acid desaturase 2' in '!Series_summary	"Increased fat intake is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. In some individuals, a failure of pancreatic b-cells to increase insulin production in response to the high demands of obesity leads to diabetes. We sought to determine whether the impaired b- cell adaptation in obesity is associated with differential expression of genes involved in b-cell expansion and intermediary metabolism. Two strains of inbred mice prone to obesity, C57Bl/6J and AKR/J, were fed regular rodent chow or high-fat diet, after which islet morphology, secretory function and gene expression were assessed. AKR/J had lower blood glucose and higher insulin levels compared with C57Bl/6J mice on regular rodent chow or high fat diet. Insulin secretion was 3.2 fold higher in AKR/J than C57Bl/6J mice following intraperitoneal glucose injection. Likewise, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated islets was higher in AKR/J. Additionally, islet mass was 1.4 fold greater in AKR/J compared with C57Bl/6J. To elucidate the factors associated with the differences in insulin, we analyzed the gene expression profiles in pancreatic islets in AKR/J and C57Bl/6J mice. Of 14,000 genes examined, 220 were up-regulated and 286 were down-regulated in islets from diet-induced obese AKR/J mice compared with C57Bl/6J mice. Key genes involved in islet signaling and metabolism, e.g. glucagon like peptide-1 receptor, sterol Co-A desaturase 1 & 2 and fatty acid desaturase 2 were upregulated in obese AKR/J mice. The expression of multiple extracellular matrix proteins was also increased in AKR/J mice, suggesting a role in modulation of islet mass. Functional analyses of differentially regulated genes hold promise for elucidating factors linking obesity to alterations in islet function. "'

Enforced expression of full-length 3' UTRs confers differences in protein expression that can in some cases be eliminated by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region.

Curcumin and rutin are polyphenolic compounds known to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, but their mechanism(s) of action are yet to be fully elucidated. Mdr1a-/- mice spontaneously develop intestinal inflammation, predominantly in the colon, with pathology similar to IBD, so this mouse model is relevant for studying diet-gene interactions and potential effects of foods on remission or development of IBD. This study tested whether the addition of curcumin or rutin to the diet would alleviate colonic inflammation in mdr1a-/- mice. Using whole-genome microarrays, the effect of dietary curcumin on gene expression in colon tissue was also investigated. Twelve mice were randomly assigned to each of three diets; control (AIN-76A), control + 0.2% curcumin or control + 0.1% rutin and monitored from the age of 7 to 24 weeks. Curcumin, but not rutin, significantly reduced histological signs of colonic inflammation in mdr1a-/- mice. Microarray and pathway analyses suggested that the effect of dietary curcumin on colon inflammation could be via an up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism and a down-regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways probably mediated by PXR and PPARalpha activation of RXR. These results reveal the potential of global gene expression and pathway analyses to study and better understand the effect of foods in colonic inflammation."'

Exposure of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to 1D8 cells, a murine model of ovarian carcinoma, suppresses their ability to express CD40 and stimulate antigen specific responses in response to PAMPs, and in particular to poly I: C with the upregulated SOCS3 transcript and protein levels. The ectopic expression of SOCS3 in both the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and BMDCs decreased signaling in response to both poly I:C and IFNα. Further, knockdown of SOCS3 transcripts significantly enhanced the responses of RAW264.7 and BMDCs to both poly I: C and IFNα. Immunoprecipitation and pull-down studies demonstrate that SOCS3 binds to the IFNα receptor TYK2. Since poly I: C triggers autocrine IFNα signaling, binding of SOCS3 to TYK2 may thereby suppress the activation of BMDCs by polyI:C and IFNα.

Such ""non-genetic cell individuality"" can arisefrom the slow fluctuations of protein levels in mammalian cells. Thesefluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering aclonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whetherthis heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fatedecisions in stem cells which depends on the kinetics that underliesheterogeneity.  Here we show that in clonal populations of hematopoieticprogenitor cells, spontaneous ""outlier"" cells with extremely high or lowexpression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 reconstitute theparental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week.This slow relaxation is described by a Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM) thatincorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations,suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despiteclonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although theunique gene expression profiles eventually reversed to that of themedian cells, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly differentproclivity for choosing either the erythroid or myeloid lineages. Preference in lineage choice was associated with elevated expression oflineage-specific transcription factors, such as > 200-fold increase inGATA1 among the erythroid-prone cells, or > 15-fold PU.1 expressionamong myeloid-prone cell. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expressionlevel is not due to independent noise in the expression of individualgenes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuatingtranscriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern thereversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cellfate decision."'

Results were highly reproducible, even across laboratories. With a dedicated Bayesian model, we found differential expression of 3179 transcripts with an estimated false-discovery rate of 8.5%. This is a much higher figure than found for microarrays. The overlap in differentially expressed transcripts found with deep sequencing and microarrays was most significant for Affymetrix. The changes in expression observed by deep sequencing were larger than observed by microarrays or quantitative PCR. Relevant processes such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity and vesicle transport along microtubules were found affected by deep sequencing but not by microarrays. While undetectable by microarrays, antisense transcription was found for 51% of all genes and alternative polyadenylation for 47%.

Found 'hook' in '!Series_summary	"During development of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) are generated from common neural precursor cells (NPCs). However, neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis, which normally commences at later stages of fetal telencephalic development. Astrocyte differentiation of mouse NPCs at embryonic day (E) 14.5 (relatively late gestation) is induced by activation of the transcription factor STAT3, whereas at E11.5 (mid-gestation) NPCs do not differentiate into astrocytes even when stimulated by STAT3-activating cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This can be explained in part by the fact that astrocyte-specific gene promoters are highly methylated in NPCs at E11.5, but other mechanisms are also likely to play a role. We therefore sought to identify genes involved in the inhibition of astrocyte differentiation of NPCs at midgestation. We first examined gene expression profiles in E11.5 and E14.5 NPCs, using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis, applying the Percellome method to normalize gene expression level. We then conducted in situ hybridization analysis for selected genes found to be highly expressed in NPCs at midgestation. Among these genes, we found that N-myc and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (Hmga2) were highly expressed in the E11.5 but not the E14.5 ventricular zone of mouse brain, where NPCs reside. Transduction of N-myc and Hmga2 by retroviruses into E14.5 NPCs, which normally differentiate into astrocytes in response to LIF, resulted in suppression of astrocyte differentiation. However, sustained expression of N-myc and Hmga2 in E11.5 NPCs failed to maintain the hypermethylated status of an astrocyte-specific gene promoter. Taken together, our data suggest that astrocyte differentiation of NPCs is regulated not only by DNA methylation but also by genes whose expression is controlled spatio-temporally during brain development."'

Reprogramming of mouse and human somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, designated as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, has been possible with the expression of the transcription factor quartet Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4. Considering that ectopic expression of c-Myc causes tumourigenicity in offspring and retroviruses themselves can cause insertional mutagenesis, the generation of iPS cells with a minimal number of factors may hasten the clinical application of this approach. Here, we show that adult mouse neural stem cells express higher endogenous levels of Sox2 and c-Myc than embryonic stem cells, and that exogenous Oct4 together with either Klf4 or c-Myc are sufficient to generate iPS cells from neural stem cells. These two-factor (2F) iPS cells are similar to embryonic stem cells at the molecular level, contribute to development of the germ line, and form chimeras. We propose that, in inducing pluripotency, the number of reprogramming factors can be reduced when using somatic cells that endogenously express appropriate levels of complementing factors."'

Found 'IL-17A' in '!Series_summary	"CD4+ T cells can differentiate into multiple effector subsets but the potential roles of these subsets in anti-tumor immunity have not been fully explored. We sought to study the impact of CD4+ T cell polarization on efficacy of tumor rejection in a model closely mimicking human disease where the target antigens are often non-mutated tissue differentiation self-antigens. We generated a new transgenic mouse model in which CD4+ T cells recognize a novel epitope in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1), an antigen that is expressed by normal melanocytes and B16 murine melanoma. We found that cells could be robustly polarized into Th0, Th1 and Th17 subtypes in vitro, as evidenced by cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule profiles as well as by surface markers, suggesting the potential for differential effector function in vivo. Contrary to the current view that Th1 cells play the most important role in tumor rejection, we found that Th17-polarized cells were superior in mediating destruction of advanced B16 melanoma. Unexpectedly, their therapeutic effect was critically dependent on IFN-γ production, while depletion of IL-17A and IL-23 had little impact. Taken together, these data indicate that the appropriate in vitro polarization of effector CD4+ T cells is decisive for the successful tumor eradication. This principle should be taken under consideration in the design of future clinical trials involving adoptive transfer-based immunotherapy of human malignancies."'

Gene expression analysis revealed distinct clusters of transcriptional profiles in single- and repeated-dose mice and rats.  Pathway analysis showed differences in biological pathways between single- and repeated-dose mice and rats. Activation of the MAPK signaling cascade and ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitory function, as well as inhibition of TGF-beta signaling, were specific to mice and suggest a role in hepatocyte proliferation. Although pathological analysis showed no evidence of apoptosis, gene expression analysis revealed changes in apoptosis-related genes. In addition to the previously reported suppression of apoptosis, results in repeated-dose mice showed that toxicity induced by TCE in turn induces apoptosis."'

In addition to changes in adipose tissue, numerous studies have reported alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism. Livers of CLA fed mice gain mass due to lipid accumulation; however, the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. To elucidate these mechanisms, we examined fatty acid composition and gene expression profiles of livers from a polygenic obese line of mice fed 1% trans-10, cis-12 CLA. Following examination of the fatty acid profile it was concluded that stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) activity was unaffected by CLA. Analysis of gene expression data led to the identification of 1393 genes differentially expressed in the liver of CLA fed mice at a nominal P-value of 0.01 and 775 were considered significant using a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05. Following Bonferroni correction and excluding lowly expressed transcripts, 198 genes were identified as being differentially expressed with 17 genes having ≥ 2-fold change.

Found 'cyclin D1' in '!Series_summary	"The LIM-only protein FHL2 acts as a transcriptional modulator that positively or negatively regulates multiple signaling pathways. We recently reported that FHL2 cooperates with CBP/p300 in the activation of ß-catenin/TCF target gene cyclin D1. In this paper, we demonstrate that FHL2 is associated with the cyclin D1 promoter at the TCF/CRE site, providing evidence that cyclin D1 is a direct target of FHL2. We show that deficiency of FHL2 greatly reduces the proliferative capacity of spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts which is associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and p16INK4a, and hypophosphorylation of Rb. Reexpression of FHL2 in FHL2-null fibroblasts efficiently restores cyclin D1 levels and cell proliferative capacity, indicating that FHL2 is critical for cyclin D1 activation and cell growth. Moreover, ectopic cyclin D1 expression is sufficient to override growth inhibition of immortalized FHL2-null fibroblasts. Gene expression profiling revealed that FHL2 deficiency triggers a broad change of the cell cycle program that is associated with downregulation of several G1/S and G2/M cyclins, E2F transcription factors and DNA replication machinery, thus correlating with reduced cell proliferation. This change also involves downregulation of the negative cell cycle regulators, particularly INK4 inhibitors, which could counteract the decreased expression of cyclins, allowing cells to grow. Our study illustrates that FHL2 can act on different aspects of the cell cycle program to finely regulate cell proliferation."'

One of BCR-ABL isoforms, P210, is more often detected in CML and ALL patients. Although BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors are effective in controlling the diseases, they do not provide cure due to the development of drug resistance and the insensitivity of leukemia stem cells to these drugs. Identification of new therapeutic targets is critical. To identify potential target against leukemia stem cells, we studied gene expression in leukemia stem cells, which were identified in mice in our lab (Hu Y, Swerdlow S, Duffy TM, Weinmann R, Lee FY, Li S.  2006. Targeting multiple kinase pathways in leukemic progenitors and stem cells is essential for improved treatment of Ph+ leukemia. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103(45):16870-16875.). The sorted leukemia stem cells that expressed BCR-ABL were used for isolation of RNA, followed by the analysis of gene expression using the DNA microarray.  The same lineage of non-BCR-ABL-expressing normal hematopoietic stem cells was used as control. We have identified some interesting genes that are up- or down-regulated by BCR-ABL in these leukemia stem cells. We are currently studying the functions of these identified genes."'

To better understand the immune mechanisms contributing to clearance of infection, microarray methods were used to examine differential gene expression in the lungs of  C57BL/6 and CD40 ligand knock-out (CD40L-KO) mice over time following exposure to Pneumocystis. Immuncompetent C57BL/6 mice, which control and clear infection efficiently, showed a robust response to infection characterized by the upregulation of 349 primarily immune-response associated genes.  Temporal changes in the expression of these genes suggested that there was an early (week 2) primarily innate response, that waned without controlling infection; this were followed by primarily adaptive immune responses that peaked at week 5 and successfully cleared the infection. In conjunction with the latter, there was an increased expression of B cell associated (immunoglobulin) genes at week 6 that persisted through 11 weeks.   In contrast, CD40L-KO mice, which are highly susceptible to developing severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, showed essentially no upregulation of immune-response associated genes at days 35 to 75. Immunohistochemical staining supported these observations by demonstrating an increase in CD4+, CD68+, and CD19+ cells in C57BL/6 but not CD40L-KO mice. Thus, the healthy host demonstrates a robust biphasic response to infection by Pneumocystis; CD40 ligand is an essential upstream regulator of the adaptive immune responses that efficiently control infection and prevent development of progressive pneumonia."'

Found 'CD3' in '!Series_summary	"Familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (fPAH) is associated with mutations in BMPR2. Many of these mutations occur in the BMPR2 tail domain, leaving the SMAD functions intact. In order to determine the in vivo consequences of BMPR2 tail domain mutation, we created a smooth-muscle specific doxycycline inducible BMPR2 mutation with an arginine to termination mutation at amino acid 899. When these SM22-rtTA x TetO7-BMPR2R899X mice had transgene induced for 9 weeks, starting at 4 weeks of age, they universally developed pulmonary vascular pruning as assessed by fluorescent microangiography. Approximately half the time the induced animals developed elevated right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP), associated with extensive pruning, muscularization of small pulmonary vessels, and development of large structural pulmonary vascular changes. These lesions included large numbers of macrophages and T-cells in their adventitial compartment, as well as CD133 positive cells in the lumen. Small vessels filled with CD45 positive and sometimes CD3 positive cells were a common feature in all SM22-rtTA x TetO7-BMPR2R899X mice. Gene array experiments show changes in stress response, muscle organization and function, proliferation and apoptosis, and developmental pathways before RVSP increases. Our results show that the primary phenotypic result of BMPR2 tail domain mutation in smooth muscle is pulmonary vascular pruning leading to elevated RVSP, associated with early dysregulation in multiple pathways with clear relevance to PAH. This model should be useful to the research community in examining early molecular and physical events in the development of PAH, and as a platform to validate potential treatments."'

Found 'FAK' in '!Series_summary	"Distinctions between craniofacial and axial muscles exist from the onset of development and throughout adulthood. The masticatory muscles are a specialized group of craniofacial muscles that retain embryonic fiber properties throughout adulthood, suggesting that the developmental origin of these muscles may govern a pattern of expression that differs from limb muscles. To determine the extent of these differences, expression profiling of total RNA isolated from the masseter and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of adult female mice was performed, which identified transcriptional changes in unanticipated functional classes of genes in addition to those associated with fiber type. In particular, the masseters displayed a reduction of transcripts associated with load-sensing and anabolic processes, and heightened expression of genes associated with stress. Consistent with these observations were a significantly smaller fiber cross-sectional area in masseters, significantly elevated load-sensing signaling (phosphorylated Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)), and increased apoptotic index in masseters compared to TA muscles. Based on these results, we hypothesize that masticatory muscles may sense and respond to load differently than limb muscles, where the drive for anabolic processes is reduced, and cell stress mediated processes are enhanced. These results establish a novel classification for the masseter muscle in the spectrum of skeletal muscle allotypes, and may provide insight into the molecular basis for specific muscle-related pathologies associated with masticatory muscles.

The larger titin isoform N2BAs gradually decreased with ages, in contrast, the smaller titin isoform N2B increased in normal cardiomyocyte, and cardiac myocytes containing a higher proportion of the smaller titin isoform N2B have stronger passive tension than that with a lower proportion of the larger titin isoform N2BAs. Recently we found an autosomal dominant mutation which caused totally opposite cardiac titin isoform expression as compared to developmental stages. The larger total titin isoform N2BA increased in mutant rat cardiac myocytes with ages instead of the smaller cardiac titin isoform N2B. For the moment, mechanism of titin isoform switch is still unknown, therefore, the mutant rats will give us nevol sight to elucidate the titin splicing mechanism."'

Initial behavioral characterization of the mice revealed that they had significant learning deficits together with abnormalities in prepulse inhibition (PPI). At the molecular level, we found that the expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43, one of the targets of HuD, was increased in the hippocampus of HuD transgenic mice.

Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

Found 'Fzd2' in '!Series_summary	"Epithelial organs including the lung are known to possess regenerative abilities through activation of endogenous stem cell populations but the molecular pathways regulating stem cell expansion and regeneration are not well understood.  Here we show that Gata6 regulates the temporal appearance and number of bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in the lung leading to the precocious appearance of BASCs and concurrent loss in epithelial differentiation in Gata6 null lung epithelium.  This expansion of BASCs is the result of a dramatic increase in canonical Wnt signaling in lung epithelium upon loss of Gata6. Expression of the non-canonical Wnt receptor Fzd2 is down-regulated in Gata6 mutants and increased Fzd2 or decreased β-catenin expression rescues, in part, the lung epithelial defects in Gata6 mutants.  During lung epithelial regeneration, we show that canonical Wnt signaling is activated in the niche containing BASCs and forced activation of Wnt signaling leads to a dramatic increase in BASC numbers.  Moreover, Gata6 is required for proper lung epithelial regeneration and postnatal loss of Gata6 leads to increased BASC expansion and decreased differentiation.  Together, these data demonstrate that Gata6 regulated Wnt signaling controls the balance between stem/progenitor expansion and epithelial differentiation required for both lung development and regeneration."'

Here we show that combination therapy with GSIs plus glucocorticoids can improve the antileukemic effects of GSIs and reduce their gut toxicity in vivo. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL restored glucocorticoid receptor auto-up-regulation and induced apoptotic cell death through induction of BIM expression. Additionally, cotreatment with glucocorticoids induced Ccnd2 upregulation in the gut which protected mice from the intestinal secretory metaplasia typically induced by loss of NOTCH signaling. These results support a role for glucocorticoids plus GSIs in the treatment of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL."'

Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."'

Methods: We generated mice in which the Gata4 gene was specifically deleted in the small intestinal epithelium.  Measurements of plasma cholesterol and phospholipids, intestinal absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol, and gene expression were performed on these animals. Results: Mice lacking GATA4 in the intestine displayed a dramatic block in their ability to absorb cholesterol and dietary fat. Comparison of the global gene expression profiles of control jejunum, control ileum, and GATA4 null jejunum by gene array analysis demonstrated that GATA4 null jejunum lost expression of 53% of the jejunal-specific gene set and gained expression of 47% of the set of genes unique to the ileum. These alterations in gene expression included a decrease in mRNAs encoding lipid and cholesterol transporters as well as an increase in mRNAs encoding proteins involved in bile acid absorption. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that GATA4 is essential for jejunal function including fat and cholesterol absorption and confirm that GATA4 plays a pivotal role in determining jejunal versus ileal identity.

There were reproducible changes in the pattern of gene expression over time. This was mediated by a small group of “major inducers” (IL1A, IL1B, TNF, IFNG) whose activity was modulated by several “minor inducers” (NFKB1, IL6, IL15, IL18, STAT1, STAT2). The subsequent decline in gene activation was mediated by “suppressors” (MYC, IL1RN, SOCS1, SOCS3, NFKBIA, IL10, FOS) that actively down-regulated gene expression and targeted both major and minor inducers. Thus, the regulation of TLR9 dependent gene activation involves multiple waves of stimulation mediated by a small number of “major” and “minor” inducers followed by the active inhibition of gene expression by “suppressors”."'

PGT is typically performed on 8-cell embryos derived from either in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) followed by extended culture.  PGT requires a highly invasive embryo biopsy procedure that involves 1) incubating embryos in divalent-cation-deficient medium to disrupt cell adhesion, 2) breaching the protective zona pellucida with acid Tyrode’s, laser drilling, or mechanical force and 3) aspirating one or two blastomeres.  In this study we developed a mouse model of the embryo biopsy procedure inherent to PGT to determine the effect of various aspects of the procedure (incubation in Ca2+/Mg2+-free medium (CMF), acid Tyrode’s treatment, blastomere aspiration), performed individually or in combination, on global patterns of gene expression in the resulting blastocysts."'

Found 'CR' in '!Series_summary	"Background: Calorie restriction (CR) is the only intervention known to extend lifespan in a wide range of organisms, including mammals. However, the mechanisms by which it regulates mammalian aging remain largely unknown and the involvement of the TOR and Sirtuin pathways (which regulate aging in lower organisms) remain controversial. Femaleness is a second phenotype generally associated with longevity but the relationship between sex-biased and CR-induced gene expression remains undetermined.    Methodology/Principal Findings: We generated microarray gene expression data from livers of male mice fed high calorie or CR diets, and we find that CR significantly changes the expression of over 3,000 genes, many between 10- and 50-fold. We compare our data to the GenAge database of known aging-related genes and to prior microarray expression data of genes expressed differently between male and female mice. CR generally feminizes gene expression and many of the most significantly changed individual genes are involved in aging, hormone signaling, and p53-associated regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. Among the genes showing the largest and most statistically significant CR-induced expression differences are Ddit4, a key regulator of the TOR pathway, and Nnmt, a regulator of lifespan linked to the Sirtuin pathway. Using Western analyses, we confirmed post-translational inhibition of the TOR pathway.    Conclusions: Our data show that CR induces widespread gene expression changes and acts through highly evolutionarily conserved pathways, from microorganisms to mammals, and that its life-extension effects might arise partly from a shift toward a gene expression profile more typical of the longer-lived female sex."'

Found 'F4/80' in '!Series_summary	"Background: Obesity is associated with infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue. Adipose macrophages may contribute to an elevated inflammatory status by secreting a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNFalpha and IL-6. Recent data suggest that during diet-induced obesity the phenotype of adipose-resident macrophages changes from alternatively activated macrophages towards a more classical and pro-inflammatory phenotype. Here, we explore the effect of PPARγ-activation on obesity-induced inflammation in 129SV mice fed a high fat diet for 20 weeks. High fat feeding increased bodyweight gain, adipose tissue mass and liver triglycerides. Rosiglitazone treatment further increased adipose mass, reduced liver triglycerides and changed adipose tissue morphology towards smaller adipocytes. Surprisingly, rosiglitazone markedly increased the number of macrophages in adipose tissue, as shown by immunohistochemical analysis and quantification of macrophage marker genes CD68 and F4/80+. In adipose tissue, markers for classically activated macrophages including IL-18 were down regulated whereas markers characteristic for alternatively activated macrophages (Arginase 1, IL-10) were up regulated by rosiglitazone. Importantly, conditioned media from rosiglitazone-treated alternatively activated macrophages neutralized the inhibitory effect of macrophages on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that alternatively activated macrophages may be involved in mediating the effects of rosiglitazone on adipose tissue morphology and mass. Our results suggest that short term rosiglitazone treatment increases infiltration of alternatively activated macrophages in adipose tissue. The alternatively activated macrophages might play a role in PPARγ-dependent expansion and remodeling of adipose tissue."'

RNA-binding proteins are key players in the post-transcriptional control of many neural genes and they participate in multiple processes, from RNA splicing and mRNA transport to mRNA stability and translation. Our laboratory has developed the first mouse model overexpressing a RNA-binding protein, the ELAV-like protein HuD, in the CNS under the control of the CaMKinII alpha promoter. Initial behavioral characterization of the mice revealed that they had significant learning deficits together with abnormalities in prepulse inhibition (PPI). At the molecular level, we found that the expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43, one of the targets of HuD, was increased in the hippocampus of HuD transgenic mice."'

Here we demonstrate that tumor cells growing in a pre-irradiated bed, or selected in vitro though repeated cycles of severe hypoxia, retain an invasive and metastatic capacities when returned to normoxia. HIF activity, while it facilitates metastatic spreading of tumors growing in a pre-irradiated bed, is not essential. Through gene expression profiling and gain and loss of function experiments, we identified the matricellular protein CYR61 and aVb5 integrin, as proteins cooperating to mediate these effects. Inhibition of aVb5 integrin suppressed invasion and metastasis induced by CYR61 and attenuated metastasis of tumors growing within a pre-irradiated field. These results represent a conceptual advance to the understanding of the tumor bed effect and identify CYR61 and aVb5 integrin as proteins that co-operate to mediate metastasis. They also indicate aV integrin inhibition a potential therapeutic approach for preventing metastasis in patients at risk for post-radiation recurrences, which can be promptly tested in the clinic."'

Found 'HD' in '!Series_summary	"Transcriptional dysregulation plays a major role in the pathology of Huntington's disease (HD). However, the mechanisms causing selective downregulation of genes remain unknown. Histones regulate chromatin structure and thereby control gene expression; recent studies have demonstrated a therapeutic role for histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in polyglutamine diseases. This study demonstrates that despite no change in overall acetylated histone levels, histone H3 is hypo-acetylated at promoters of downregulated genes in R6/2 mice, ST14a and STHdh cells, as demonstrated by in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation. In addition, HDAC inhibitor treatment increases association of acetylated histones with downregulated genes and corrects mRNA abnormalities. In contrast, there is a decrease in mRNA levels in wild-type cells following treatment with a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor. Although changes in histone acetylation correlate with decreased gene expression, histone hypo-acetylation may be a late event, as no hypo-acetylation is observed in 4-week-old R6/2 mice. Nevertheless, treatment with HDAC inhibitors corrects mRNA abnormalities through modification of histone proteins and may prove to be of therapeutic value in HD."'

Found 'Mbp' in '!Series_summary	"Detailed analyses of the clone-based genome assembly reveal that the recent duplication content of mouse (4.94%) is now comparable to that of human (5.5%), in contrast to previous estimates from the whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly. The architecture of mouse and human genomes differ dramatically; most mouse duplications are organized into discrete clusters of tandem duplications that are depleted for genes/transcripts and enriched for LINE1 and LTR retroposons. We assessed copy-number variation of the C57BL/6J duplicated regions within 15 mouse strains used for genetic association studies, sequencing, and the mouse phenome project. We determined that over 60% of these basepairs are polymorphic between the strains (on average 20 Mbp of copy-number variable DNA between different mouse strains). Our data suggest that different mouse strains show comparable, if not greater, copy-number polymorphism when compared to human; however, such variation is more locally restricted. We show large and complex patterns of inter-strain copy-number variation restricted to large gene families associated with spermatogenesis, pregnancy, viviparity, phermone signaling, and immune response."'

Found 'M1' in '!Series_summary	"Streptococcus pyogenes is a major causative agent of tonsillitis or pharyngitis in children, which can lead to more invasive infections and noninfectious sequellae. S. pyogenes can persist in tonsils, while one-third of children treated with antibiotics continue to shed streptococci and have recurrent infections. Mouse nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) is functionally analogous to human oropharangeal lymphoid tissues. The innate immune responses of naïve cells from a mucosal site to S. pyogenes is not well described; therefore, we infected C57BL/6 mice intranasally with 108 CFU S. pyogenes. Transcriptional responses by NALT after S. pyogenes infection were analyzed by Affymetrix microarray and quantitative RT-PCR.  Wild-type S. pyogenes induces transcription of both type I and IFN-gamma-responsive genes, pro-inflammatory genes, and acute phase response plasma proteins within 24h after infection.   Invasion of NALT and the induction of the interferon response were not dependent on expression of anti-phagocytic M1 protein.  However, infection with an attenuated, less invasive mutant indicated that a robust innate response by NALT is significantly influenced by intra-NALT bacterial load.  Granulocytic populations of NALT, cervical lymph nodes and spleen were discriminated by characteristic surface and intracellular markers.  Intranasal infection induces systemic release of neutrophils and a substantial influx of neutrophils into NALT at 24h, which decline by 48h after infection.  Macrophages do not significantly increase in S. pyogenes-infected NALT.  Intranasal infection of IFN-gamma -/- (GKO) C57BL/6 mice did not lead to systemic dissemination of wild type S. pyogenes, despite reduced expression of IFN-gamma-responsive mRNAs in NALT.   Infected GKO mice had an unregulated influx of neutrophils into NALT compared to immunocompetant mice and mice treated with an anti-IFN-gamma antibody more rapidly cleared S. pyogenes from NALT.  Thus, IFN-gamma-induced responses have a suppressive influence on early clearance of this pathogen from NALT."'

Found 'TOR' in '!Series_summary	"In eukaryotes, regulation of mRNA translation enables a fast, localized and finely tuned expression of gene products.  Within the translation process, the first stage of translation initiation is most rigorously modulated by the actions of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and their associated proteins.  These 11 eIFs catalyze the joining of the tRNA, mRNA and rRNA into a functional translation complex.  Their activity is influenced by a wide variety of extra- and intracellular signals, ranging from global, such as hormone signaling and unfolded proteins, to specific, such as single amino acid imbalance and iron deficiency.  Their action is correspondingly comprehensive, in increasing or decreasing recruitment and translation of most cellular mRNAs, and specialized, in targeting translation of mRNAs with regulatory features such as a 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP), upstream open reading frames (uORFs), or an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES).  In mammals, two major pathways are linked to targeted mRNA translation.  The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase induces translation of TOP and perhaps other subsets of mRNAs, whereas a family of eIF2 kinases does so with mRNAs containing uORFs or an IRES.  TOR targets translation of mRNAs that code for proteins involved in translation, an action compatible with its widely accepted role in regulating cellular growth.  The four members of the eIF2 kinase family increase translation of mRNAs coding for stress response proteins such as transcription factors and chaperones.  Though all four kinases act on one main substrate, eIF2, published literature demonstrates both common and unique effects by each kinase in response to its specific activating stress.  This suggests that the activated eIF2 kinases regulate the translation of both a global and a specific set of mRNAs.  Up to now, few studies have attempted to test such a hypothesis; none has been done in mammals."'

These Leishmania are living within a communal parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and are expected to trigger unique MΦ transcriptional signatures. We performed a transcription profiling of mouse MΦs harboring amastigotes to get insights into their reprogramming as host cells for parasite multiplication. BALB/c mouse bone marrow-derived MΦs were either loaded or not with four amastigotes on average. Twenty four hours later, when amastigotes multiply, total RNA from MΦ cultures was prepared, amplified and hybridized onto Affymetrix Mouse430_2 GeneChips®. The outcome recorded a total of 1,248 probe-sets showing significant differential expression. Comparable fold-change values for a handful of genes were obtained between Affymetrix technology and the more sensitive RTqPCR method. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software® pinpointed the up-regulation of the sterol biosynthesis pathway (P-value = 1.31e-02) involving several genes (1.95 to 4.30 fold-change values), and the modulation of various genes involved in polyamine synthesis and in pro/counter-inflammatory signaling.

The cholangitis involves differential hepatic transcription of genes whose products govern inflammation, activation of hepatic stellate cells and fibrosis.  This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that several genes involved in regulation of tissue inflammation and fibrosis display transcription rates that reflect SC disease activity. Methods. Abcb4 (-/-) mice fed cholic acid (CA) display high SC activity and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) fed mice display low SC activity. Differential hepatic transcription of genes was accordingly measured in abcb4 (-/-) mice maintained on CA- and UDCA-supplemented diets using cDNA microarrays. Abcb4 (+/+) mice served as controls. The differential transcription of selected genes was verified by real time polymerase chain reaction. Liver tissue pathology was quantified by histopathology scoring and immunohistochemistry to visualize bile duct cells and activated hepatic stellate cells. Results. Differential transcription of  Ccl2, Ccl20, Cxcl10, Nfκb1, Nfκb2, Tgfβ1, Tgfβ2, Sparc, Ctgf, Lgals3, Elf3, Spp1, Pdgfa, Pdgfrb, Col1a1, Col1a2 and Col4a1 genes paralleled the differing SC activities of cholic acid- and UDCA-fed abcb4 (-/-) mice. Histopathology scores and immunohistochemistry showed greatly enhanced activation of hepatic stellate cells during high SC activity due to CA feeding. Conclusion. Differential transcription of several genes relating to tissue inflammation and hepatic stellate cell activation parallels SC activity in abcb4 (-/-) mice.

Found 'NF' in '!Series_summary	"The basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor twist1, as an antagonist of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent cytokine expression, is involved in the regulation of inflammation-induced immunopathology. We could show that twist1 is expressed by activated T helper (Th) 1 effector memory cells. Induction of twist1 in Th cells is dependent on NF-κB, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and interleukin (IL)-12 signaling via signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4. Expression of twist1 is transient following T-cell receptor engagement, and increases upon repeated stimulation of Th1 cells. Imprinting for enhanced twist1 expression is characteristic of repeatedly restimulated effector memory Th cells and thus of the pathogenic memory Th cells of chronic inflammation. Th lymphocytes from the inflamed joint or gut tissue of patients with rheumatic diseases, Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis express high levels of twist1. Expression of twist1 in Th1 lymphocytes limits the expression of the cytokines interferon-γ, IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and ameliorates Th1-mediated immunopathology in delayed-type hypersensitivity and antigen-induced arthritis. In order to identify the effect of twist1 expression on the function of Th cells, twist1 was ectopically expressed and the transcriptome was compared to empty-virus infected control cells. In addition, this experiment allows for the identification of genes regulated by the transcription factor twist1."'

Found 'Th2' in '!Series_summary	"Upon activation under appropriate costimulatory conditions, naive T helper (Th) cells differentiate into Th2 or Th17 cells, each characterized by the expression of specific effector cytokines. In response to a repeated stimulation with antigen, Th cells develop a stable memory for the expression of those cytokines as well as for other secreted or membrane-associated factors. The stable memory for the expression of proinflammatory effector functions may explain the resistance of Th effector cells to conventional immunosuppressive therapy, and the inability of immunosuppression to cure chronic inflammation. The imprinting of the functional memory is based on epigenetic modifications and expression of distinct transcription factors. In this project, we compare the transcriptomes of once and repeatedly activated murine Th1 cells, to identify genes that induce and maintain the functional memory and control the persistence of pathogenic memory Th1 cells. This in turn might help to discriminate pathogenic versus protective cells in immunopathology and present novel targets for the diagnosis and therapy of chronic inflammatory disease. "'

Found 'CK' in '!Series_summary	"Muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF1) is a muscle-specific protein implicated in the regulation of cardiac myocyte size and contractility. MuRF2, a closely related family member, redundantly interacts with protein substrates, and hetero-dimerizes with MuRF1. Mice lacking either MuRF1 or MuRF2 are phenotypically normal whereas mice lacking both proteins develop a spontaneous cardiac and skeletal muscle hypertrophy indicating cooperative control of muscle mass by MuRF1 and MuRF2. In order to identify the role that MuRF1 plays in regulating cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, we created transgenic mice expressing increased amounts of cardiac MuRF1. Adult MuRF1 transgenic (Tg+) hearts exhibited a non-progressive thinning of the left ventricular wall and a concomitant decrease in cardiac function. Experimental induction of cardiac hypertrophy by trans-aortic constriction (TAC) induced rapid failure of MuRF1 Tg+ hearts. Microarray analysis identified that the levels of genes associated with metabolism (and in particular mitochondrial processes) were significantly altered in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, both at baseline and during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Surprisingly, ATP levels in MuRF1 Tg+ mice did not differ from wild type mice despite the depressed contractility following TAC. To explain this discrepancy between the ongoing heart failure and maintained ATP levels in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, we compared the level and activity of creatine kinase (CK) between wild type and MuRF1 Tg+ hearts. Although mCK and CK-M/B protein levels were unaffected in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, total CK activity was significantly inhibited. We conclude that MuRF1’s inhibition of CK activity leads to increased susceptibility to heart failure following TAC, demonstrating for the first time that MuRF1 regulates cardiac energetics in vivo."'

Found 'claudin 4' in '!Series_summary	"Background & Aims: HNF4α is an important transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte and pancreatic function. Hnf4α deletion is embryonically lethal with severe defects in visceral endoderm formation, liver maturation and colon development.  However, the precise role of this transcription factor in maintaining homeostasis of the adult intestine remains unclear.  Herein, we aimed to elucidate the adult intestinal functions of Hnf4α.  Methods: A conditional intestinal epithelial Hnf4α knockout mouse was generated.  Histological abnormality of the colonic mucosa was assessed by immunodetection and Western.  Changes in global gene expression and biological network were analyzed.  Results: Hnf4α intestine null mice developed normally until reaching young adulthood. Crypt distortion became apparent in the Hnf4α null colon at 3 months of age followed by focal areas of crypt dropout, increased immune cell infiltrates, crypt hyperplasia and early signs of polyposis later in life.  A gene profiling analysis identified cell death and cell cycle related to cancer as the most significant sets of genes altered in the Hnf4α colon null mice.  Expression levels of the tight junction proteins claudin 4, 8 and 15 were altered early in the colon epithelium of Hnf4α mutants and correlated with increased barrier permeability to a molecular tracer that does not normally penetrate normal mucosa.  Conclusion: These observations support a functional role for Hnf4α in protecting the colonic mucosa against the initiation of the changes resembling inflammatory bowel diseases and polyp formation."'

Found 'erythropoietin' in '!Series_summary	"Iron is essential for all cells but is toxic in excess, so iron absorption and distribution are tightly regulated.  Serum iron is bound to transferrin and primarily enters erythroid cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis of the transferrin receptor (Tfr1).  Tfr1 is essential for developing erythrocytes and reduced Tfr1 expression is associated with anemia.  The transcription factors STAT5A/B are activated by many cytokines, including erythropoietin.  Stat5a/b-/- mice are severely anemic and die perinatally, but no link has been made to iron homeostasis.  To study the function of STAT5A/B in vivo, we deleted the floxed Stat5a/b locus in hematopoietic cells with a Tie2-Cre transgene.  These mice exhibited microcytic, hypochromic anemia, as did lethally irradiated mice transplanted with Stat5a/b-/- fetal liver cells.  Flow cytometry and RNA analyses of erythroid cells from mutant mice revealed a 50% reduction in Tfr1 mRNA and protein.  We detected STAT5A/B binding sites in the first intron of the Tfr1 gene and found that expression of constitutively active STAT5A in an erythroid cell line increased Tfr1 levels.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the binding of STAT5A/B to these sites.  We conclude that STAT5A/B is an important regulator of erythroid progenitor iron uptake via its control of Tfr1 transcription."'

Found 'DBP5' in '!Series_summary	"The conserved mRNA nuclear export receptor NXF1 (Mex67 in yeast) assembles with messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNP) in the nucleus and guides them through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the cytoplasm. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 is essential for nuclear export of mRNA and is thought to dissociate Mex67 from mRNP upon translocation, thereby generating directional passage. However, the molecular mechanism by which Dbp5 recognizes Mex67-containing mRNP is not clear. Here we report that the human NXF1-binding protein RBM15 binds to DBP5 specifically and enables its direct contact with mRNA. We found that RBM15 is enriched at the nuclear envelope and colocalizes with DBP5 at the NPC. Knockout of RBM15’s orthologue in mouse (Ott1) leads to global changes in mRNA expression and excessive mRNA accumulation in the cytoplasm, indicating an essential role of RBM15 in mRNA export regulation. We propose that RBM15 acts locally at the NPC, by transiently bridging the NXF1-mRNP complexes to DBP5, thereby contributing to the substrate specificity of mRNA export. "'

Although thymic Tregs developed normally in this setting, the cells showed evidence of altered differentiation and dysfunction in the periphery. Dicer-deficient Treg lineage cells failed to remain stable as a subset of cells down-regulated the Treg-specific transcription factor, FoxP3, while the majority expressed altered levels of multiple genes and proteins (including Neuropilin 1, GITR and CTLA-4) associated with the Treg fingerprint. In fact, a significant percentage of the Treg lineage cells took on a Th memory phenotype including increased levels of CD127, IL-4, and interferon-g. Importantly, Dicer-deficient Tregs lost suppression activity in vivo; the mice rapidly developed fatal systemic autoimmune disease resembling the FoxP3 knockout phenotype. These results support a central role for miRNAs in maintaining the stability of differentiated Treg function in vivo and homeostasis of the adaptive immune system."'

In comparing expression patterns of regulated genes by E2, we observed that there are good similarities between gene expression profiles obtained by MAS5.0 and RMA.

Lhx8(-/-) ovaries misexpress oocyte-specific genes such as Gdf9, Pou5f1, and Nobox. Very rapid loss of oocytes may partly be due to drastic the down-regulation of Kit and Kitl in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries. We compared Lhx8(-/-) and wild-type ovaries using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray platform. Eighty (44%) of 180 of the genes down-regulated more than 5-fold in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries were preferentially expressed in oocytes, whereas only 3 (2%) of 146 genes up-regulated more than 5-fold in the absence of Lhx8 were preferentially expressed in oocytes. In addition, the comparison of genes regulated in Lhx8(-/-) and Nobox(-/-) newborn ovaries discovered a common set of 34 genes whose expression level is affected in both Lhx8 and Nobox deficient mice. Our findings show that Lhx8 is a critical factor for maintenance and differentiation of the oocyte during early oogenesis and it acts in part by down-regulating the Nobox pathway."'

Found 'Afp' in '!Series_summary	"Background & Aims: MiRNAs are small (~22 nucleotide), non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression through imperfect complementarity with target messenger RNAs. The function of miRNA in mammalian organogenesis is largely unknown. Conditional loss-of-function of Dicer, the enzyme that processes precursor miRNA transcripts into their mature, active form, has been shown to cause severe defects in a number of organ systems. Here we address the role of Dicer in liver development and function. Methods: Mice lacking Dicer function in hepatocytes were generated using an Afp-Cre strain to drive deletion of a floxed Dicer allele. Deletion of the flox-dicer allele was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Decreased miRNA levels detected by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed loss of Dicer function. Gene expression microarray analysis was performed on liver RNA from P28 mutant and control mice. Liver sections from mutant and control mice ranging from embryonic stages through 3-4 months of age were examined and liver function tests were performed on adult mice. Results: Mice lacking hepatocyte Dicer function were born alive at the expected frequency, and had grossly normal appearance and behavior. Despite the loss of mature miRNA, hepatic function was normal, as reflected by normal blood gludose, albumin, cholesterol, and bilirubin. However, mutant mice between 2-4 months of age exhibit progressive hepatocyte damage, elevated ALT/AST, with evidence of balanced proliferation and apoptosis in the lobule. Microarray analysis indicates large-scale changes in gene expression, with increased expression of many miRNA targets, as well as imprinted genes. Conclusions: Loss of miRNA processing in the liver at late gestation has a remarkably mild phenotype, suggesting that miRNAs do not play an essential role in hepatic physiology. However, miRNA deficiency results in hepatocyte apoptosis and balanced hepatocyte regeneration. Finally, microarray analysis of gene expression in mutant liver suggests a previously unrecognized role for Dicer in the repression of imprinted genes."'

Found 'Akr1b7' in '!Series_summary	"The cornea continues to mature after birth to develop a fully functional, refractive and protective barrier tissue. Here we investigated the complex biological events underlying this process by profiling global genome-wide gene expression patterns of the immature postnatal day 10 and seven week-old adult mouse cornea. The lens and tendon were included in the study to increase the specificity of genes identified as up regulated in the corneal samples. Notable similarities in gene expression between the cornea and the tendon were in the mesenchymal extracellular matrix collagen (types I, III, V, VI) and proteoglycan (lumican, decorin and biglycan) genes. Expression similarities in the cornea and lens were limited to certain epithelial genes and the crystallins. Approximately 76 genes were over expressed in the cornea samples that showed basal expression levels in the lens and tendon. Thirty-two of these were novel with no known functions in the cornea. These include genes with a potential role in protection against oxidative stress (Dhcr24, Cdo1, Akr1b7, Prdx6), inflammation (Ltb4dh, Wdr1), ion-transport (Pdzk1ip1, Slc12a2, Slc25a17) and transcription (Zfp36l3, Pdzk1ip1). Direct comparison of the cornea of two ages showed selective up regulation of 50 and 12 genes in the P10 and adult cornea, respectively. Of the up regulated P10 genes several encode extracellular matrix collagens and proteoglycans that are stable components of the adult cornea and their high transcriptional activity at P10 indicate a period of active corneal growth and matrix deposition in the young cornea. Much less is known about the genes selectively over expressed in the adult cornea; some relate to immune response and innervations (Npy), and possibly to electron transport (Cyp24a1, Cyp2f2) and others of yet unknown functions in the cornea (Rgs10, Psmb8, Xlr4)). This study detected expression of genes with known functions in the cornea, providing additional validation of the microarray experiments. Importantly, it identified several novel genes whose functions have not been investigated in the cornea."'

Found 'EPA' in '!Series_summary	"Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) act as potent natural hypolipidemics and are linked to many health benefits in humans and in animal models. Mice fed long-term a high fat diet, in which medium-chain alpha linoleic acid (ALA) was partially replaced by long-chain docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) fatty acids, showed reduced accumulation of body fat and prevention of insulin resistance, besides increased mitochondrial beta-oxidation in white adipose tissue and decreased plasma lipids. ALA, EPA and DHA all belong to PUFA of n-3 series. The intestine is a gatekeeper organ for ingested lipids. To examine the potential contribution of the intestine in the beneficial effects of EPA and DHA, this study assessed gene expression changes using whole genome microarray analysis on small intestinal scrapings. The main biological process affected was lipid metabolism. Fatty acid uptake, peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and omega-oxidation of fatty acids were all increased. Quantitative real time PCR and intestinal fatty acid oxidation measurements ([14C(U)]-palmitate) confirmed significant gene expression differences in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, no major changes in the expression of lipid metabolism genes were observed in colonic scrapings. In conclusion, we show that marine n-3 fatty acids regulate small intestinal gene expression patterns. Since this organ contributes significantly to whole organism energy use, this adaptation of the small intestine may contribute to the complex and observed beneficial physiological effects of these natural compounds under conditions that will normally lead to development of obesity and diabetes."'

Found 'regulator of calmodulin signaling' in '!Series_summary	"Repeated exposure to cocaine causes sensitized behavioral responses and increased dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We find that cocaine regulates myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors to control these two processes in vivo. Cocaine suppresses striatal MEF2 activity in part through a novel mechanism involving cAMP, the regulator of calmodulin signaling (RCS), and calcineurin. We show that reducing MEF2 activity in the NAc in vivo is required for the cocaine-induced increases in dendritic spine density. Surprisingly, we find that increasing MEF2 activity in the NAc, which blocks the cocaine-induced increase in dendritic spine density, enhances sensitized behavioral responses to cocaine. Together, our findings implicate MEF2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine, and suggest that reducing MEF2 activity (and increasing spine density) in NAc may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long-lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine."'

In addition, NC cells also gives rise to another type of PNS glial cell, the boundary cap (BC) cells. These latter cells are located at the interface between central nervous system and PNS, at the exit/entry points of ventral motor and dorsal sensory axons. We have shown that in absence of BC cells motor neurons translocate their cell bodies along their axons into the periphery. Moreover, in vivo tracing of BC cells revealed that they give rise to all Schwann cells in the nerve roots and to a subset of nociceptive neurons and satellite cells in the dorsal root ganglia. To identify novel molecular markers for BC cells, we have performed RNA profiling experiments to compare mouse BC cells with two closely related cell types, NC cells and Schwann cells precursors, and tested the most promising candidates by in situ hybridization. This work defined a set of 10 genes that show specific expression in BC cells and/or in their derivatives located along nerve roots.  Using this collection we show that dorsal and ventral BC cells and their derivatives express different genes, suggesting that they have distinct properties. We also establish that BC cells undergo a major modification between embryonic days 14.5 and 17.5.

Putative LMX1B target genes have been identified through mouse gene targeting studies; however, in the absence of in vivo molecular characterization of their regulation, their identity as direct LMX1B targets remains hypothetical. We describe here the first molecular characterization of LMX1B target gene regulation. A tetracycline-inducible expression system and microarray analysis showed that a subset of NF-kappa B target genes, including IL-6 and IL-8 are upregulated in LMX1B-expressing HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that LMX1B binds to the proximal promoter region of IL-6 and IL-8 in vivo, in the vicinity of the characterized kappa B site, and that LMX1B recruitment correlates with an increased NF-kappa B DNA association. Inhibition of NF-kappa B activity by short interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of p65 impairs LMX1B-dependent induction of NF-kappa B target genes, while activation of NF-kappa B activity by TNF-alpha results in a synergistic induction of these genes by LMX1B. IL-6 promoter-driven reporter assays showed that the kappa B site and an adjacent putative LMX1B binding motif are both involved in LMX1B-mediated transcription. Expression of a number of NF-kappa B target genes is affected in the kidney of Lmx1b-/- knock-out mice, thus supporting the biological relevance of the data obtained in the human cell line. Together, these data demonstrate for the first time that LMX1B directly regulates transcription of a subset of NF-kappa B target genes in cooperation with nuclear p50/p65 NF-kappa B."'

In skeletal muscle, laminin a2 chain binds at least two receptor complexes; the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and integrin a7b1. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder, we performed gene expression profiling of laminin a2 chain deficient mouse limb muscle. One of the down-regulated genes encodes a protein called calcium and integrin binding protein 2 (Cib2) whose expression and function is unknown. However, the closely related Cib1 has been reported to bind integrin aIIb and may be involved in outside-in-signaling in platelets. Since Cib2 might be a novel integrin a7b1 binding protein in muscle, we have studied Cib2 expression in the developing and adult mouse. Cib2 mRNA is mainly expressed in the developing central nervous system and in developing and adult skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle Cib2 colocalizes with integrin a7B subunit at the sarcolemma and at the neuromuscular- and myotendinous junctions. Finally, we demonstrate that Cib2 is a calcium binding protein that interacts with integrin a7Bb1D.

It has also been reported to oppose terminal granulopoiesis and to support leukemic cell growth through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.  We used kinetic microarray, Northern Blotting and bioinformatics analysis of IL-3 dependent myeloblasts to determine whether IL-3 acts in part by regulating the rate of turnover of mRNA transcripts in specific functional pathways.  Our results indicate that exposure of myeloblasts to IL-3 causes immediate early stabilization of hundreds of transcripts in pathways relevant to myeloblast function.  Examples include transcripts associated with proliferation and leukemic transformation (pik3cd, myb, pim-1), hematopoietic development (cited2), differentiation control (cdkn1a) and RNA processing (BRF1, BRF2).  A domain in the 3’-utr of IL-6 that mediates IL-3 responsiveness contains AU-rich elements that bind proteins known to modulate mRNA stability, however a known destabilizing protein (AUF1) is shown not to mediate degradation in the absence of IL-3.    These findings support a model of IL-3 action through mRNA stability control and suggest that aberrant stabilization of this network of transcripts could contribute to growth patterns observed in leukemia."'

IKKα induces keratinocyte terminal differentiation and its reduction promotes skin tumor development. However, its nature function in skin cancer is unknown. Here we found that mice with IKKα deletion in keratinocytes or in hair follicle keratinocytes developed a thickened epidermis and spontaneous squamous cell-like carcinomas. Inactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or reintroduction of IKKα inhibited excessive mitosis, induced terminal differentiation, and prevented skin cancer through an EGFR-driven autocrine loop in mice.

Gene Ontology (GO) terms for inflammation and the ribosome were significantly enriched by LPS, whereas GO terms associated with learning and memory had decreased expression. We detected 224 changed transcripts in the cerebral cortex and 170 in the hippocampus. Expression of Egr1 (also known as Zif268) and Arc, two genes associated with learning and memory, was significantly lower in the cortex, but not hippocampus, of LPS-treated animals.

The molecular machinery governing basal progenitor biogenesis is unknown. Here we show that the zinc finger transcription factor Insm1 (insulinoma-associated 1) is expressed  specifically in progenitors undergoing neurogenic divisions and has a key role in basal progenitor formation. Mouse embryos lacking Insm1 contained half the number of basal progenitors and showed a marked reduction in cortical plate radial thickness. Forced premature expression of Insm1 in neuroepithelial cells resulted in their mitosis occurring at the basal (rather than apical) side of the ventricular zone and induced expression of the basal progenitor marker Tbr2. Remarkably,  these cells remained negative for Tis21, a marker of neurogenic progenitors, and did not generate neurons but underwent self-amplification. Our data imply that Insm1 is involved in the generation  and expansion of basal progenitors, a hallmark of cerebral cortex evolution."'

To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift, a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent, all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly, the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes, while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction, Adhesion, Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered, including sodium channel, nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b), glutamate receptor (Grin1), voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1), calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response, learning and memory, ion channels and cell junction. In particular, data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore, HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes."'

We found that inflammation leads to aberrant DNA methylation in Polycomb target genes, with 70% of the ~250 genes methylated in the inflamed tissue being PcG targets in embryonic stem cells and 58% of the methylated genes being marked by H3K27 trimethylation in the ileum of adult wildtype mice. Acquisition of DNA methylation at CpG islands in the ileum of Gpx-1/2-KO mice frequently correlated with loss of H3K27 trimethylation at the same loci. Inflammation-associated DNA methylation occurs preferentially in tissue-specific silent genes and, importantly, is much more frequently represented in tumors than is age-dependent DNA methylation. 60% of aberrant methylation found in tumors is also present in the inflamed tissue. In summary, inflammation creates a signature of aberrant DNA methylation, which is observed later in the malignant tissue and is directed by the PcG complex."'

BDC T cells were a mixture of cells expressing high, intermediate and low levels of the T cell receptor. Clonotype-low BDC T cells were required for LTP. Furthermore, islet infiltrating leukocytes in the LTP mice contained Foxp3+CD4 T cells. Islet inflammation in both diabetic and LTP mice was characterized by heavy infiltration of macrophages. Gene expression profiles indicated that macrophages in diabetic mice were M1-type, while LTP mice contained M2-differentiated. The LTP was abolished if mice were treated with either an antibody depleting CD4 T cells, or a neutralizing antibody to CTLA-4, in this case, only at a late stage. Neutralization of IL-10, TGF-β, GITR or CD25 had no effect. Transfer of only clonotype-high expressing BDC T cells induced diabetes but in contrast, H22 antibodies did not inhibit diabetes. While clonotype high T cells induced diabetes even when IFN-γ was neutralized, paradoxically, there was reduced inflammation and no diabetes if host myeloid cells lacked IFN-γ receptor. Hence, using monoclonal CD4 T cells, IFN-γ can have a wide diversity of roles, depending on the setting of the immune process."'

However, the cells from which these tumors originate (neural progenitors or stem cells), the cells that are responsible for tumor propagation (cancer stem cells), and the genes that are required for tumor progression are poorly understood. To address these questions, we have developed conditional patched knockout mice in which the gene is deleted in neural stem cells or progenitors. In addition, we have isolated a population of tumor-propagating cells from these tumors. By studying these models we will gain insight into the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and identify new targets for therapy."'

Found 'tip' in '!Series_summary	"A fundamental question in biology is how an undifferentiated field of cells acquires spatial pattern and undergoes coordinated differentiation. The development of the vertebrate limb is an important paradigm for understanding these processes. The skeletal and connective tissues of the developing limb all derive from a population of multipotent progenitor cells located in its distal tip. During limb outgrowth, these progenitors segregate into a chondrogenic lineage, located in the center of the limb bud, and soft connective tissue lineages located in its periphery. We report that the interplay of two families of signaling proteins, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and Wnts, coordinate the growth of the multipotent progenitor cells with their simultaneous segregation into these lineages. FGF and Wnt signals act together to synergistically promote proliferation while maintaining the cells in an undifferentiated, multipotent state, but act separately to determine cell lineage specification. Withdrawal of both signals results in cell cycle withdrawal and chondrogenic differentiation. Continued exposure to Wnt however, maintains proliferation and re-specifies the cells towards the soft connective tissue lineages. We have identified target genes that are synergistically regulated by Wnts and Fgfs, and show how these factors actively suppress differentiation and promote growth. Finally, we show how the spatial restriction of Wnt and FGF signals to the limb ectoderm and to a specialized region of it, the apical ectodermal ridge, controls the distribution of cell behaviors within the growing limb, and guides the proper spatial organization of the differentiating tissues."'

Genes that reside in the PAR1 are exceptional in that they are rich in repetitive sequences and undergo a very high rate of recombination.  Remarkably, murine PAR1 homologs have translocated to various autosomes, reflecting the complex recombination history during the evolution of the mammalian X chromosome.  We now report that the SNF2-type chromatin remodeling protein ATRX controls the expression of eutherians ancestral PAR1 genes that have translocated to autosomes in the mouse.  In addition, we have identified two potentially novel mouse PAR1 orthologs.  We propose that the ancestral PAR1 genes share a common epigenetic environment that allows ATRX to control their expression."'

A small fraction of WT ESCs incorporates into the mdx mouse nonuniformly to upregulate protein levels of dystrophin in the skeletal muscle. The chimeric muscle shows reduced regeneration and restores dystrobrevin, a dystrophin-related protein, in areas with high and with low dystrophin content.

However, germline Ott1 deletion  results in fetal demise prior to E10.5, indicating additional developmental requirements for Ott1. The spen gene family, to which Ott1 belongs, has a transcriptional activation/repression domain and RNA recognition motifs, and in Drosophila has a significant role in the development of the head and thorax. Early Ott1-deficient embryos show growth retardation and incomplete closure of the notochord. Further analysis demonstrated placental defects in the spongiotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast layers, resulting in an arrest of vascular branching morphogenesis. Rescue of the placental defect using a conditional allele with a trophoblast-sparing cre transgene allowed embryos to form a normal placenta and survive gestation. This result shows that the process of vascular branching morphogenesis in Ott1-deficient animals is regulated by the trophoblast compartment rather than the fetal vasculature. Mice surviving to term manifested hyposplenia and abnormal cardiac development. Analysis of global gene expression of Ott1-deficient embryonic hearts shows enrichment of hypoxia-related genes and significant alteration of several candidate genes critical for cardiac development. Thus, Ott1-dependent pathways in addition to being implicated in leukemogenesis, may also be important in the pathogenesis of placental insufficiency and cardiac malformations."'

However, there is little information on tissue-specific gene expression in response to social stress, which reflects our daily life. Liver is one of the most important organs, owing to its biological functions such as energy metabolic homeostasis, metabolization and detoxification of endo- and exogenous substances. In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying response to social stress in the liver, we investigated hepatic gene expression in mice exposed to isolation stress using DNA microarray. Male BALB/c mice (4 weeks old) were housed 5 per cage for 10 days acclimatization. Then mice were exposed to isolation stress for 30 days. After stress treatment, the mouse liver RNA was subjected to DNA microarray analysis. Taking the false discovery rate into account, isolation stress altered expression of 420 genes. Moreover, Gene Ontology analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that isolation stress remarkably down-regulated lipid metabolism-related pathway through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), while lipid biosynthesis pathway regulated by sterol regulatory element binding factor-1 (SREBF-1), Golgi vesicle transport and secretory pathway-related genes were significantly up-regulated. These results suggested that isolation for 30 days, mild and consecutive social stress, not only regulate the systems for lipid metabolism but also cause the endoplasmic reticulum stress in mouse liver."'

Found 'DHP' in '!Series_summary	"New insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells are formed primarily by self-replication during adult life. To identify small molecules that can induce beta cell replication, a large chemical library was screened for proliferation of growth-arrested, reversibly immortalized mouse beta-cells using an automated high-throughput screening platform. A number of structurally diverse, active compounds were identified including phorbol esters, which likely act through protein kinase C, and a group of thiophene-pyrimidines that stimulate beta-cell proliferation by activating the Wnt signaling pathway. A group of dihydropyridine (DHP) derivatives was also shown to reversibly induce beta-cell replication in vitro by activating L-type calcium channels (LTCCs). Our data indicate that the LTCC agonist 2a affects the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. Furthermore, treatment of beta-cells with both LTCC agonist 2a and the Glp-1 receptor agonist Ex-4 showed an additive effect on beta-cell replication. The identification of small molecules that induce beta-cell proliferation suggests that it may be possible to reversibly expand other quiescent cells to overcome deficits associated with degenerative and/or autoimmune diseases."'

Found 'Col1a1' in '!Series_summary	"Col1a1 is located on mouse distal chromosome 11 (Celera 94607393-94622990bp; 15kb) and encodes type I procollagen that associates stoichiometrically with col1a2 in forming secreted type I mature collagen that self-assembles into a supramolecular fibrillar structure consisting of a protein family. Type I collagens are predominantly enriched in bone, cartilage, skin, tendons, and eye (i.e. in major fibrous tissues) making up the main extracellular matrix (ECM) component for support and scaffolding purposes. Col1a1 is known to be expressed in the embryo (E9.5; Northern dot blot), perioptic mesenchyme (E11), cornea (E11), skeleton (E14.5), brain meninges (E14.5), and cartilage (E14.5) at relatively early stages. Most evidence of type I collagen function is coupled to the latter stages of skeletal development, thus bypassing the major events of axis formation, tissue differentiation, and mesenchlymal-epithial interactions, for example, that are more symbolic of morphogens and growth factors. Members of the integrin cell surface receptor family of molecules mediate cell adhesion to ECM proteins such as collagen (mainly to type IV basement membrane collagen that forms into a polygonal meshwork), fibronectin, and laminin implicated in wound healing and inflammatory responses (e.g. Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis) in connective tissues. There is some evidence for protein-protein interactions between leukocyte-associated integrins and the interstitial matrix in promoting the migration and/or activation of extravasated leukocytes (e.g., T cells and monocytes) within the perivascular compartment, an ECM-rich environment. This region is surmised to be an important location where certain human leukocytes undergo differentiation (e.g. monocytes) and activation (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes) upon extravascular migration. The von Willebrand factor (vWF), type C motif is found in various plasma proteins like complement factors, the integrins, collagen types, and other extracellular proteins. Thus, the majority of vWF-containing proteins are extracellular and a common feature appears to be involvement in multi protein complexes participating in numerous biological events (e.g. cell adhesion, migration, homing, pattern formation, and signal transduction)."'

Found 'Cav' in '!Series_summary	"Here, we show that functional loss of a single gene is sufficient to confer constitutive milk protein production and protection against mammary tumor formation. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in striated and smooth muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine if genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we next studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3 (-/-) null mice. Interestingly, detailed analysis of Cav-3 (-/-) virgin mammary glands shows dramatic increases in ductal thickness, side-branching, and the development of extensive lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Analysis by genome-wide expression profiling reveals the upregulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. The expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc are also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly show that Cav-3 (-/-) mice undergo precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic implantation of a transformed mammary cell line (known as Met-1), we demonstrate that virgin Cav-3 (-/-) mice are dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Interestingly, Cav-3 (+/-) mice also show similar protection, indicating that even reductions in Cav-3 levels are sufficient to render these mice resistant to tumorigenesis. Thus, Cav-3 (-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a constitutive lactogenic microenviroment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic micro-environment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers. Most importantly, a lactation-based therapeutic strategy would provide a more natural and nontoxic approach to the development of novel anti-cancer therapies."'

Found 'Gja1' in '!Series_summary	"Phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of SMAD proteins determine the cellular response to activin.  Here we identify a novel means by which activin signalling is regulated to enable developmental stage-specific SMAD gene transcription.  In response to activin A, immature proliferating mouse Sertoli cells exhibit nuclear accumulation of SMAD3, but not SMAD2, although both proteins are phosphorylated.  In post-mitotic differentiating cells, both SMAD2 and SMAD3 accumulate in the nucleus.  Furthermore, immature Sertoli cells are sensitive to activin dosage; at higher concentrations maximal SMAD3 nuclear accumulation is observed, accompanied by a small, but significant, increase in nuclear SMAD2.  Microarray analysis confirmed that differential SMAD utilization correlated with altered transcriptional outcomes and identified new activin target genes, Gja1 and Serpina5, which are known to be required for Sertoli cell development and male fertility.  In immature Sertoli cells, genetic or transient knockdown of SMAD3 enhanced SMAD2 nuclear accumulation in response to activin, with increased Serpina5 mRNA levels associated with nuclear localized SMAD2.  In transgenic mice with altered activin bioactivity that display male fertility phenotypes, testicular Gja1 and Serpina5 mRNA levels reflected altered in vivo activin levels.  We conclude that regulated nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated SMAD2 is a novel determinant of developmentally regulated activin signalling."'

We used three mouse models of Down syndrome, involving either an extra chromosome or translocation trisomy, to test requirements and consequences of meiotic protein modification and gene silencing in spermatocytes.  These models reveal that copy number alone is not sufficient for up-regulation of genes in the trisomic interval, and that MSUC-promoting modifications are not sufficient for down-regulation of genes that reside in unpaired chromatin during meiosis.  The position of a trisomic region relative to a centromere, the pairing status of the centromere, and the physical extent of the unpaired chromosomal region all affected assembly of meiotic protein modifications typical of MSUC.  One key determinant to modification of unpaired chromatin and infertility in trisomy male mice appears to be proximity of unpaired chromatin to a centromere.  Furthermore, the presence of an extra, unpaired centromere, but not translocation trisomy, causes global misregulation of transcription in spermatocytes.  Thus, neither trisomy per se, nor chromatin modifications of unpaired chromosomal segments, have major effects on gene expression or meiotic success, but an intact unpaired chromosome has profoundly negative effects on meiotic gene expression."'

In addition to their deleterious effects on male genital development, population studies have recently documented correlations between phthalates exposure and subtle impacts on reproductive tract development and on the metabolic syndrome in male adults. In mature rodents liver di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) activates the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPARalpha), a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily.  OBJECTIVES: Using a systems biology approach, we aimed at defining potential mechanisms underlying the impacts of DEHP on adult mouse liver and testis.  METHODS: Thus, we performed a parallel analysis of transcript and metabolic profiles in the liver from adult mice exposed to varying DEHP doses. Moreover, we obtained pangenomic mRNA profiles of laser-captured Leydig and Sertoli cells from mature animals exposed to DEHP.  RESULTS: Hepatic genes modulated by DEHP are predominantly PPARalpha targets. However, the induction of some prototypic cytochrome P450 genes strongly supports the activation of additional NR pathways. Integration of hepatic transcriptomic and metabonomic profiles further revealed a correlation between the impacts of DEHP on a cluster of genes and metabolites linked to heme synthesis and on a cluster of Rev-erbalpha target genes related to metabolic and circadian clock pathways. Cell-specific effects of DEHP were investigated in the adult testis and a noticeable impact of DEHP was observed on Leydig cells transcriptome.

The high HbF BCL11A genotype is associated with reduced BCL11A expression. Moreover, abundant expression of full-length forms of BCL11A is developmentally restricted to adult erythroid cells. Down-regulation of BCL11A expression in primary adult erythroid cells leads to robust HbF expression. Consistent with a direct role of BCL11A in globin gene regulation, we find that BCL11A occupies several discrete sites in the beta-globin gene cluster.

Gene-environment interactions played a key role as high-fat feeding eliminated the beneficial effects of the Pro12Ala variant on adiposity, plasma lipids, and insulin sensitivity. The underlying molecular mechanisms involve changes in cofactor interaction and adiponectin signaling.

In the adult small intestine, an example of high rate self-renewing tissue, four different epithelial cell lineages (enterocytes, Goblet, enteroendocrine and Paneth cells) are generated from a pool of stem cells localised at the bottom of the crypts of Lieberkühn. Recently, the orphan Leucine-rich repeat G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPR49), a target of Wnt signalling, has been proposed as a marker for such cells. We investigated the role of LGR5 during intestinal development by using LGR5 null/LacZ-NeoR knock-in mice. We show that LGR5 deficiency leads to premature Paneth cell differentiation. X-gal staining on E18.5 intestine revealed that LGR5 expression is restricted to a few cells clustered within the intervillus region known to contain progenitor cells. In LGR5-null mice, expression from the LGR5 promoter was found upregulated, suggesting a loss of negative feedback control. However, neither epithelial cell proliferation nor cell migration appeared significantly impaired by LGR5 deficiency. Finally, transcriptional profiling of ileal mutant mice suggests that LGR5 plays a role in regulating the Wnt and Notch signalling pathways controlling progenitor renewal and differentiation."'

Found 'VEGFR1' in '!Series_summary	"The molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis in relation to adipose tissue metabolism remain poorly understood. Here we show that exposure of mice to cold led to conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown-like adipose tissue, accompanying the switch of an active angiogenic phenotype.  Gene expression profile analysis showed VEGF was upregulated via most likely hypoxia-independent PGC-1 transcriptional activation.  Intriguingly, VEGFR2 blockage abolished the cold-induced angiogenesis, significantly impaired nonshivering thermogenesis capacity, and markedly reduced adipose metabolism.  Unexpectedly, VEGFR1 blockage resulted in opposite effects by increasing adipose vascularity and metabolism.  These findings demonstrate that VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 mediate polarized activities in modulating adipose angiogenesis and metabolism. Taken together, our findings have conceptual implications in applying angiogenesis modulators for the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders."'

Although the rationale for oral diseases applications (e.g. oral cancer) is clear, the rationale and relationship between systemic diseases and saliva biomarkers are unknown. In this study, we used mouse models of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer and compared the transcriptome biomarker profiles of tumor-bearing mice to those of control mice. Microarray analysis showed that salivary transcriptomes were significantly altered in tumor-bearing mice vs. controls. Analysis of the transcriptomes in the mouse tumors, serum, salivary glands and saliva revealed that salivary biomarkers have multiple origins. Furthermore, we identified that the expression of two groups of significantly altered transcription factors Runx1, Mlxipl, Trim30 and Egr1, Tbx1, Nr1d1 in melanoma-bearing mice that can potentially be responsible for 82.6% of the up-regulated genes expression and 62.5% of the down-regulated gene expression in the mice saliva, respectively. We also confirmed that the ectopic production of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the melanoma tumor tissue as a tumor-released mediator that can induce expression of the transcription factor Egr-1 in the salivary gland. Taken together, our data support the conclusion that upon systemic disease development, a disease-specific change occurs in the salivary biomarker profile. Although the origins of the disease-specific salivary biomarkers are both systemic and local, stimulation of salivary gland by mediators released from remote tumors play an important role in regulating the salivary surrogate biomarker profiles.

To uncover the genetic determinants and molecular mechanisms of ADPKD, we analyzed 4-point time-series DNA microarrays from Pkd1L3/L3 mice to generate high-resolution gene expression profiles at different stages of disease progression. We found different characteristic gene expression signatures in the kidneys of Pkd1L3/L3 mice compared to age-matched controls during the initial phase of the disease. By postnatal week 1, the Pkd1L3/L3 kidney already had a distinctive gene expression pattern considerably different from the corresponding normal controls.  The genes differentially expressed, either induced or repressed, in ADPKD are important in immune defense, cell structure and motility, cellular proliferation, apoptosis and metabolic processes, and include members of three pathways (Wnt, Notch, and BMP) involved in morphogenetic signaling. Further analysis of the gene expression profiles from the early stage of cystogenesis to end stage disease identified a possible gene network involved in the pathogenesis of  ADPKD."'

Following growth for 24 hours after initial plating, approximately 10,000,000 cells were dissasociated from dishes with the use of Cell Dissasociating Buffer (Gibco). Cells were resuspended in FACs buffer (10%FCS in PBS) and incubated on ice. Marking of SSEA 1expression was achieved by a 10 minute incubation with  a mouse monoclonal antibody to SSEA 1 (MC-480, Developmental Hybridoma Studies Bank, University of Iowa). Following several washes with FACs buffer, cells were then incubated with an Alexa-647 conjugated anti-mouse IgM anitbody (Invitrogen) for a further 10 minutes. Cells were then washed and resuspended in FACs buffer and subpopulations were fractionated by flow cytometry from two different clones of the HIV cell line (clone 5.1 and clone 16.1). The aim of this array experimnt is to identify significant differences in transcript levels of the four subpopulation from the HIV cell line.

Found 'S100' in '!Series_summary	"The recent identification of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in multiple human cancers provides a new inroad to understanding tumorigenesis at the cellular level.  CSCs are defined by their characteristics of self-renewal, multipotentiality, and tumor initiation upon transplantation.  By testing for these defining characteristics, we provide evidence for the existence of CSCs in a transgenic mouse model of glioma, S100ß-verbB;Trp53.   In this glioma model, CSCs are enriched in the side-population (SP) cells.  These SP cells have enhanced tumor-initiating capacity, self-renewal, and multipotentiality compared to non-SP cells from the same tumors.  Furthermore, gene expression analysis comparing FACS-sorted cancer SP cells to non-SP cancer cells and normal neural SP cells identified 45 candidate genes that are differentially expressed in glioma stem cells.  We validated the expression of two genes from this list (S100a4 and S100a6) in primary mouse gliomas and human glioma samples.  Analyses of xenografted human GBM (glioblatoma multiforme) cell lines and primary human glioma tissues show that S100A4 and S100A6 are expressed in a small subset of cancer cells and that their abundance is positively correlated to tumor grade.  In conclusion, this study shows that CSCs exist in a mouse glioma model, suggesting that this model can be used to study the molecular and cellular characteristics of CSCs in vivo and to further test the cancer stem cell hypothesis."'

The data  provides the first positional and temporal map PPARγ and RXR occupancy during adipocyte differentiation at a global scale. The number of PPARγ:RXR shared binding sites is steadily increasing from D0 to D6. At Day6 there are over 5000 high confidence shared PPARy:RXR binding sites. We show that at the early days of differentiation several of these sites bind not only PPARγ:RXR but also other RXR dimers. The data also provides a comprehensive temporal map of RNAPII occupancy at genes throughout 3T3-L1 adipogenesis thereby uncovering groups of similarly regulated genes belonging to glucose and lipid metabolic pathways. The majority of the upregulated but very few downregulated genes have assigned PPARγ:RXR target sites, thereby underscoring the importance of PPARγ:RXR in gene activation during adipogenesis and indicating that a hitherto unrecognized high number of adipocyte genes are directly activated by PPARγ:RXR"'

Based on previously well-documented anti-tumor activity of CLA in rodent models of breast cancer, a pilot study was initiated to examine the effect of dietary CLA in a well-established transgenic model of breast cancer.  Western blots were performed for the detection of AKT, c-Src, ERK1/2, and Cdc24. CLA significantly increased tumor burden (p<0.1) independent of an increase in oncogenic signaling. Mammary gland whole mounts indicated a loss of mammary adipose and extensive epithelial expansion in CLA-treated animals. Microarray analysis indicated a significant reduction in cytoskeletal related genes with at least a two-fold decrease in five out of six CLA-fed animals compared to untreated controls. Reduction of Cdc42, a key regulator of cell adhesion and cytoskeletal arrangements, was confirmed at the protein level by western blot (p<0.01). These findings suggest that dietary CLA may advance the malignant phenotype by promoting a loss of cell polarity and adhesion in the mammary gland epithelium. This action may have serious clinical implications for a subset high-risk population and warrants further investigation."'

Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."'

Expression of mRNAs was profiled in both experiments and the intersection of mRNAs repressed by miR-140 overexpression and derepressed by silencing of miR-140 was identified. The intersection contained only 49 genes, although both treatments affected the accumulation of hundreds of mRNAs. These 49 genes showed a very strong enrichment for the miR-140 seed sequence implying that the approach is efficient and specific. 21 of these 49 genes were predicted to be direct targets based on the presence of the seed sequence. Interestingly, none of these were predicted by the published target prediction methods we used.

We successfully obtained the rate of mRNA decay for 19 977 non-redundant genes by microarray analysis of RNA samples obtained from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Median estimated half-life was 7.1 h and only <100 genes, including Prdm1, Myc, Gadd45 g, Foxa2, Hes5 and Trib1, showed half-life less than 1 h. In general, mRNA species with short half-life were enriched among genes with regulatory functions (transcription factors), whereas mRNA species with long half-life were enriched among genes related to metabolism and structure (extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton). The stability of mRNAs correlated more significantly with the structural features of genes than the function of genes: mRNA stability showed the most significant positive correlation with the number of exon junctions per open reading frame length, and negative correlation with the presence of PUF-binding motifs and AU-rich elements in 30 -untranslated region (UTR) and CpG di-nucleotides in the 50 -UTR.

To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and Aspergillus fumigatus.  Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line.  Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kappa-B, Type I and II interferon, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways.  Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection.  Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly upregulated.  Taken together, stimulated innate resistance (StIR) appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection."'

To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and Aspergillus fumigatus.  Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line.  Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kappaB, Type I and II interferon, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways.  Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection.  Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly upregulated.  Taken together, stimulated innate resistance (StIR) appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection."'

Many of these defects are suppressed by mutation of an activating E2F, E2f1 or E2f3, indicating that they are key downstream targets of the retinoblastoma protein, pRB. In this study, we assess how E2F4 contributes to the developmental consequences of pRb-loss.  In stark contrast to the activating E2Fs, the homozygous mutation of E2f4 shortened the lifespan of Rb-/- embryos. This resulted from an exacerbation of the placental defect of the Rb-/- mice indicating that E2F4 and pRB cooperate in the development of this tissue. Further analyses indicated that this defect reflects an increase in trophectoderm-like cells. Under conditions where the placenta was wild-type but the embryo mutant for E2f4 and pRb embryos survived to birth and exhibited all of the defects that were observed in the E2f4 and Rb single mutant embryos. Thus, while pRB and E2F4 cooperate in placental development, they play largely non-overlapping roles the development of many embryonic tissues."'

Here, we report a new approach to identifying large non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) by using chromatin-state maps to discover discrete transcriptional units intervening known protein-coding loci. Our approach identified ~1600 large multi-exonic RNAs across four mouse cell types. In sharp contrast to previous collections, these large intervening ncRNAs (lincRNAs) exhibit strong purifying selection in their genomic loci, exonic sequences, and promoter regions – with greater than 95% showing clear evolutionary conservation. We also developed a novel functional genomics approach that assigns putative functions to each lincRNA, revealing a diverse range of roles for lincRNAs in processes from ES pluripotency to cell proliferation. We obtained independent functional validation for the predictions for over 100 lincRNAs, using cell-based assays. In particular, we demonstrate that specific lincRNAs are transcriptionally regulated by key transcription factors in these processes such as p53, NFKB, Sox2, Oc4, and Nanog.

No cardiac functional data is available for almost half of these receptors. Cluster analysis allowed us to link GPCR expression patterns to cardiac function. Indeed, ventricles and atria are both contractile; however, the latter, and especially the right atrium, are central to the generation and regulation of cardiac rhythm. Accordingly, the right atrium exhibited the most specific signature whereas the vast majority of GPCRs found in ventricles were evenly expressed in both the right and left chambers.

Aortas of 3 male and 3 female C57Bl6 mice were isolated, perfused with triton X-100 to remove endothelial cells and divided in an atherosclerosis-prone region (AA: ascending aorta, aortic arch and proximal 2 mm of thoracic aorta) and an atherosclerosis-resistant region (TA: central thoracic aorta,i.e. 6 mm distal from the proximal 2mm of the thoracic aorta). Microarray analysis (VIB-MAF) of pooled total RNA showed differential expression (>2-fold difference) for 70 genes. Up- or downregulation in the AA was observed for 33 and 37 genes respectively. Differential expression of 3 genes (ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 1 polypeptide, sarcolipin and homeo box B7) was confirmed using real-time PCR. Twenty five genes showed exclusively differential expression in C57BL6 mice. Only 7 could be linked to specific processes: development (4) and cell growth (3). The other 18 genes were all involved in different processes. Among the 45 genes showing differential expression in C57Bl/6 as well as apoE-/- mice, most were related to development (13), cell growth (8) and transcription (10). These results point to an altered transcriptome in SMCs of the C57Bl/6 aorta at an atherosclerosis-prone location. This is in agreement with findings in endothelial cells in atherosclerosis-prone regions. It could be due to biomechanical differences, for instance in wall tension or shear stress, or the different embryological origin of SMCs in AA and TA."'

Furthermore, the transcription profile of the AA was in accordance with a more synthetic SMC phenotype.

Found 'ob' in '!Series_summary	"Despite years of effort, exact pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains obscure. To gain an insight into the regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in aberrant energy metabolic status and pathogenesis of NAFLD, we analyzed the expression of miRNAs in livers of ob/ob mice, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice and normal C57BL/6 mice by miRNA microarray. Compared to normal C57BL/6 mice, ob/ob mice showed up-regulation of 8 miRNAs and down-regulation of 4 miRNAs in fatty livers. Up-regulation of miR-34a and down-regulation of miR-122 was found in livers of STZ-induced diabetic mice. These results demonstrate that distinct miRNAs are strongly dysregulated in NAFLD and hyperglycemia. Comparison between miRNA expressions in livers of ob/ob mice and STZ-administered mice further revealed up-regulation of 4 miRNAs and down-regulation of 2 miRNAs in livers of ob/ob mice, indicating that these miRNAs may represent a molecular signature of NAFLD. A distinctive miRNA expression pattern was identified in ob/ob mouse liver and hierarchical clustering of this pattern could clearly discriminate ob/ob mice from either normal C57BL/6 mice or STZ-administered mice. These findings suggest an important role of miRNAs in hepatic energy metabolism and implicate the participation of miRNAs in the pathophysiological processes of NAFLD."'

Here, we performed genome-wide mapping of tissue-specific in vivo binding sites for the enhancer-associated protein p300 and assessed in transgenic mice the utility of this information in identifying enhancers and predicting their activity patterns.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing was used to identify p300-enriched sites in mouse embryonic day 11.5 (e11.5) forebrain, midbrain, and limb.  In total, 4,686 genomic regions were enriched for p300 in vivo in at least one of these tissues.  To determine whether p300-binding accurately identifies enhancers and predicts their activity patterns, we tested 86 of these regions in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay at e11.5.  In 88% of the cases, p300-enriched sequences were reproducible enhancers, and in 91% of these cases p300 enrichment correctly predicted the tissues in which in vivo activity was observed.  Our results indicate that in vivo mapping of p300 binding to non-coding DNA is a highly effective means for identifying enhancers and their associated spatial activity patterns."'

We report here that the C57Bl6 mouse model of experimental infection with the closely related H. felis recapitulates this wide range in host susceptibility. A majority of infected mice develop premalignant lesions such as gastric atrophy, compensatory epithelial hyperplasia and intestinal metaplasia, whereas a minority is completely protected from preneoplasia. Protection is associated with the failure to mount an IFN-gamma response to the infection and an associated high Helicobacter burden. We demonstrate that IFN-gamma is essential for clearance of Helicobacter, but also mediates the formation of preneoplastic lesions. We further provide evidence that IFN-gamma triggers a specific transcriptional program in murine gastric epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, and induces their preferential transformation to the hyperplastic phenotype. In summary, our data suggest a dual role for IFN-gamma in Helicobacter pathogenesis that could provide an explanation for the differential susceptibility to H. pylori-induced gastric pathology in the human population."'

Antagonism of miR-122 is due to formation of stable heteroduplexes between the LNA-antimiR and miR-122 as detected by northern analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated uptake of the LNA-antimiR in mouse liver cells, which was accompanied by markedly reduced hybridization signals for mature miR-122 in treated mice. Functional antagonism of miR-122 was inferred from a low cholesterol phenotype and de-repression within 24 h of 199 liver mRNAs showing significant enrichment for miR-122 seed matches in their 3' UTRs. Expression profiling extended to 3 weeks after the last LNA-antimiR dose revealed that most of the changes in liver gene expression were normalized to saline control levels coinciding with normalized miR-122 and plasma cholesterol levels. Combined, these data suggest that miRNA antagonists comprised of LNA are valuable tools for identifying miRNA targets in vivo and for studying the biological role of miRNAs and miRNA-associated gene-regulatory networks in a physiological context."'

Distinct global gene expression profiles are associated with anchorage-independent colonies arising from bFGF-stimulated JB6 cells, relative to colonies arising from fully tumorigenic JB6 cells (RT101), including genes exhibiting reciprocal regulation patterns.  Thus, while TPA exposure results in commitment to an irreversible and tumorigenic AIG phenotype, the AIG response to bFGF is reversible with essentially complete restoration of normal cell cycle check point control following removal of bFGF from growth medium.  These results are consistent with the physiological role of bFGF in promoting wound healing, and suggest that natural mechanisms exist to reverse transformative cellular phenotypes associated with carcinogenesis."'

Found 'Bmal1' in '!Series_summary	"Hair follicles undergo recurrent cycling of controlled growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes."'

Found 'DM' in '!Series_summary	"Diabetes mellitus [DM], with its burden of premature morbidity and mortality, represents one of the major threats to human health in the 21st century (Zimmet 2001). Accelerated atherosclerosis affecting arteries that supply the heart, brain and lower extremities is responsible for an increased risk of acute ischemic events. DM is also associated with microvascular disease, which is a leading cause of blindness, renal failure and debilitating neuropathies. Endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular permeability and microvascular cell loss by apoptosis are all hallmarks of diabetic microangiopathy. Diabetic patients not only incur cardiovascular complications more frequently, but also experience worse outcomes due to attenuation of vascular repair mechanisms. This impairment includes quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of bone marrow [BM]-derived progenitor cells (Emanueli 2002&2004; Loomans 2004; Krankel 2005; Fadini 2006). The mechanisms underlying BM dysfunction remain however enigmatic, especially when considering the privileged location that protects stem cells [SC] and progenitor cells [PC] of the marrow from external insults (Kopp 2008 and Kiel 2008). BM endothelial cells [EC] are instead an obvious target of DM, because they are directly exposed to blood glucose and incapable to regulate glucose influx. Strangely enough, little is known about the impact of diabetes on BM microvasculature. We hypothesize that damage induced by DM might start at the microvascular level, in a similar fashion to microangiopathy, which occurs in kidney, retina, heart and brain. We also propose that enduring microvascular cell loss might result in marrow hypo-perfusion and destabilization of SC homeostasis."'

Found 'Ezh2' in '!Series_summary	"Although in vitro studies of embryonic stem cells have identified Polycomb repressor complexes (PRCs) as key regulators of differentiation, it remains unclear as to how PRC-mediated mechanisms control fates of multipotent progenitors in developing tissues. Here, we show that an essential PRC component, Ezh2, is expressed in epidermal progenitors, but diminishes concomitant with embryonic differentiation and with postnatal decline in proliferative activity. We show that Ezh2 controls proliferative potential of basal progenitors by repressing the Ink4A-Ink4B locus, and tempers the developmental rate of differentiation by preventing premature recruitment of AP1 transcriptional activator to the structural genes that are required for epidermal differentiation. Together, our studies reveal that PRCs control epigenetic modifications temporally and spatially in tissue-restricted stem cells by maintaining their proliferative potential and globally repressing undesirable differentiation programs, while selectively establishing a specific terminal differentiation program in a step-wise fashion."'

Found 'myotubularin' in '!Series_summary	"Periphilin is a protein which is involved in multiple processes in vivo, including terminal differentiation of keratinozytes as well as cell-cycle and cancer related functions. Here we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the periphilin-1 gene to explore its physiological role from an organismic perspective. In accordance with a ubiquitous expression of periphilin in the murine embryo, the homozygous deficiency of periphilin is lethal in early embryogenesis. We therefore characterized mice with a disruption of only one periphilin allele. As heterozygous periphilin knockout mice show no obvious histological alterations and have no apparent behavioural phenotypes, we compared whole transcriptome RNA expression profiles of total brain tissue of periphilin+/- knockout mice and wild type littermates for an in-depth analysis of heterozygous animals. In periphilin+/- knockout mice, 3 probe sets were indicative of significant differential expression (p ≤ 0.05, SLR ≥ 1 which is equivalent to 2 fold). Two of these probe sets (1438864_at and 1439170_at) refer to unannotated or unclassifiable genes. According to the NetAffx™ Analysis Center, the third probe set (1447831_s_at) is assigned to myotubularin related protein 7 (Mtmr7). The probe set, however, lies upstream of the Mtmr7 gene (Ensembl gene ENSMUSG00000039431), and its signal is therefore not representative for the Mtmr7 gene. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis with a primer set specific for Mtmr7 confirmed that its expression is not altered in periphilin+/- knockout mice (relative expression compared to wild type: 0.924; p = 0.419). In summary, none of more than 45.000 covered transcripts is differentially expressed in periphilin+/- knockout mice in comparison to wild type littermates."'

Here we showed that the genes activated in cultured mouse fibroblasts in response to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor can be divided roughly into three groups, each with different induction kinetics. Whereas differential transcription is important in determining the grouping of these genes, differential mRNA stability also exerted strong influence in some cases overriding that of transcriptional control elements on the temporal order of gene expression. mRNA transcripts expressed early after TNF stimulation have abundant AU-rich elements in their 3'-untranslated regions whereas those expressed later are contain fewer AU-rich sequences. Thus mRNA stability and transcriptional control, two intrinsic characteristics of genes, control the kinetics of proinflammatory cytokine-induced gene expression."'

Found 'H19' in '!Series_summary	"It is increasingly being recognized that physical interactions between distant chromosomal loci influence the expressivity of the genome. Thus, multiple enhancers may converge on a single gene promoter 1,2 and a single enhancer can stochastically loop to multiple promoters 3. Regulatory elements from neighboring domains or from other chromosomes may interact to generate chromatin structures poised for transcription4-8 or repression 9-11. However, a broader perspective on the formation and function of such networks remains largely unexplored. Using the high-resolution 4C (Circular Chromosome Conformation Capture) analysis, we identify here a genome-wide physical network between genomically imprinted domains impinging H19 imprinting control region (ICR). Sequences interacting with the H19 ICR constitutively map at or within most of known imprinted domains both in mouse embryonic stem cells and in vitro-derived embryoid bodies, despite distinct differences in chromatin environments. Moreover, all-to-all 3D DNA FISH analyses revealed that imprinted domains from 7 different chromosomes co-localize with each other in pair-wise patterns, highlighting the dynamic nature of these interactions. The observed interaction network is dependent on CTCF binding sites within the maternally inherited H19 ICR allele and delays reprogramming of epigenetic features at imprinted domains during male germline development. As other imprinted regions can interact with each other in an H19 ICR-dependent manner, the H19 ICR emerges as an organizer of chromosomal networks by specifically recognizing and reconfiguring imprinted domains. We propose that an ancient key regulatory region, such as the H19 ICR, gradually impacted epigenetic modifications via long-range interactions in the germline to facilitate the recruitment of imprinted genes and their formation in clusters during mammalian radiation. Furthermore, the perspective of epigenetic lesions de-stabilizing such chromosomal networks may advance our understanding of how quantitative traits influence human diseases, such as cancer."'

To understand the role DNA methylation in CNS neurons, we generated conditional Dnmt1 mutant mice that possess ~90% hypomethylated cortical and hippocampal cells in the dorsal forebrain from E13.5 on.   The mutant mice were viable with a normal lifespan, but displayed severe neuronal cell death between E14.5 to 3-weeks postnatally.   Accompanied with the striking cortical and hippocampal degeneration, adult mutant mice exhibited neurobehavioral defects in learning and memory in adulthood.  Unexpectedly, a fraction of Dnmt1-/- cortical neurons survived through postnatal development, so that the residual cortex in mutant mice contained 20-30% of hypomethylated neurons throughout the life.  Hypomethylated excitatory neurons exhibited multiple defects in postnatal maturation including abnormal dendritic arborization and impaired neuronal excitability.  The mutant phenotypes are coupled with deregulation of those genes involved in neuronal layer-specification, cell death, and the function of ion channels.  Our results suggest that DNA methylation, through its role in modulating neuronal gene expression, plays multiple roles in regulating cell survival, neuronal migration and maturation in the CNS."'

Specifically, by use of laser microdissection we harvested either tumor or transgenic and non-transgenic but otherwise morphologically unaltered cells. We then searched genome wide for regulated genes and validated results by quantitative real-time PCR. Overall, 473 and 541 genes were significantly regulated when cancer versus transgenic and cancer versus non-transgenic cells were compared. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of the data clearly separated the cancer cells from transgenic and non-transgenics and we observed predominately repression of gene expression at advanced stages of tumor growth. Nonetheless genes up-regulated in dysplasia were also up-regulated in solid tumors. We observed groups of genes acting in concert either linked to development with an unexpected high number of genes coding either for the epithelial mesenchymal or mesenchymal endothelial transition. Additionally, genes coding for cell adhesion including the integrins and the tight and gap junction proteins were repressed (integrin alpha 1, integrin alpha 8, claudin 2, claudin 5, gap junction membrane channel protein alpha 5 and cadherin 5) but ligands for the membrane bound epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase i.e. epi- and amphiregulin were up-regulated. Moreover, molecules in the signalling of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 and VEGFD, Notch and WNT were regulated as were glycosylases that facilitate cellular recognition. Other regulated signalling molecules included exchange factor such as RAP guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3, RHO guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10, RAS guanine releasing protein 2 and 3, and RAS guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 that play a role in an activation of the MAP kinases."'

However, few studies have been carried out that investigate gene expression in vivo after prolonged exposure to low-dose-rate radiation. In this study, C57BL/6J mice were continuously irradiated with γ-rays for 485 days at dose-rates of 0.032 – 13 μGy/min. Gene expression profiles in the kidney and testis from irradiated and unirradiated mice were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were identified. A combination of pathway analysis and hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes revealed that expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was elevated in the kidney after irradiation at the dose-rates of 0.65 μGy/min and 13 μGy/min. Expression of cell cycle-associated genes was not profoundly modulated in the kidney, in contrast to the response to acute irradiation, suggesting a threshold in the dose-rate for modulation of the expression of cell cycle-related genes in vivo following exposure to radiation. We demonstrated that changes to the gene expression profile in the testis were largely different from those in the kidney. The Gene Ontology categories “DNA metabolism”, “response to DNA damage” and “DNA replication” overlapped significantly with the clusters of genes whose expression decreased with an increase in the dose-rate to the testis. These observations provide a fundamental insight into the organ-specific responses to low-dose-rate radiation."'

We generated genome-wide histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation maps in naïve, Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg, and natural (n)Treg cells. We found that although modifications of signature cytokine genes (Ifng, Il4, and Il17) partially conform to the expectation of lineage commitment, critical transcription factors such as Tbx21 exhibit a broad spectrum of epigenetic states, consistent with our demonstration of T-bet and IFN-gamma induction in nTreg cells.

However, REST/NRSF has a more general role in the regulation of gene expression that involves chromatin remodelling via a SWI/SNF complex. We identified a 677 gene repertoire of potential REST/NRSF-dependent genes taking advantage of Rest/Nrsf gene silencing in a mouse cell line. Using Ka/Ks analysis, we found that REST/NRSF protein, REST/NRSF interactors and the products of REST/NRSF-dependent genes display significantly higher rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. The McDonald-Kreitman test indicated positive selection for human REST/NRSF and nuclear RNA-binding proteins encoded by REST/NRSFdependent genes. In these proteins, we demonstrated sites under positive selection within the primate’s clade. Importantly, the REST/NRSF-dependent gene repertoire is statistically enriched in genes disrupted in neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. In addition, we found that Smarca2 (Brm), Smarcd3 (Baf60c), Smarce1 (Baf57), Hdac1, RcoR1, and Mecp2, which are part of the REST/NRSFSWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, are transcriptionally regulated by REST/NRSF.

These mutant IL-2Rbeta chains supported suboptimal and transient STAT5 activation that upregulate the transcription factor Foxp3 to normal amounts in natural, but not induced, Treg cells. Using cells T cell obtained from normal C57BL/6 mice and mice harboring Treg cells with impaired IL-2R signaling, gene expression profiling revealed many targets in peripheral natural Treg cells that were IL-2-dependent and a substantial overlap between the Treg cell IL-2-dependent gene program and the Treg cell transcriptional signature. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a critical, and perhaps minor, subset of IL-2-dependent targets in Treg cells is indexed to a low IL-2R signaling threshold and that a substantial proportion of the Treg cell gene program is regulated by IL-2. CD4 T effector cells also showed many IL-2R-dependent gene and these also overlapped in a distintive manner with the IL-2-dependent genes of Treg cells and the Treg gene signature."'

We utilized the CSS, 129.MOLF-Chr 19 chromosome substitution strain (or M19), in which males develop germ cell tumors of the testes at an extremely high rate.  We are able to identify 3 protein-coding genes and 1 microRNA on chromosome 19 that have previously not been implicated to be testicular tumor susceptibility genes.   Our findings suggest that changes in gene expression levels in the gonadal tissues of multiple genes from Chr 19 likely contribute to the high TGCT incidence of the M19 strain.

Found 'Akt' in '!Series_summary	"Maintenance of the blood system is dependent on dormant haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with long-term self-renewal capacity. Upon injury these cells are induced to proliferate in order to quickly re-establish homeostasis. The signalling molecules promoting the exit of HSCs out of the dormant stage remain largely unknown. Here we show that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha (IFNα), HSCs efficiently exit G0 and enter an active cell cycle. HSCs respond to IFNα treatment by increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and PKB/Akt, expression of IFNα target genes and up-regulation of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). HSCs lacking either the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR), STAT1 or Sca-1 are insensitive to IFNα stimulation, demonstrating that STAT1 and Sca-1 mediate IFNα induced HSC proliferation. Although dormant HSCs are resistant to the anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU1, HSCs pre-treated (primed) with IFNα and thus induced to proliferate are efficiently eliminated by 5-FU exposure in vivo. Conversely, HSCs chronically activated by IFNα are functionally compromised and are rapidly out competed by non-activatable IFNAR-/- cells in competitive repopulation assays. In summary, while chronic activation of the IFNα pathway in HSCs impairs their function, acute IFNα treatment promotes the proliferation of dormant HSCs in vivo. These data may help to clarify the so far unexplained clinical effects of IFNα on leukemic cells and raise the possibility for novel applications of type I interferons to target cancer stem cells.

Determining the molecular mechanisms regulating the development of granulomas and fibrosis will be essential for understanding how schistosome antigens interact with the host environment. We report here the first whole genome microarray analysis of the murine liver during the progression of Schistosoma japonicum egg-induced granuloma formation and hepatic fibrosis. Our results reveal a distinct temporal relationship between the expression of chemokine subsets and the recruitment of cells to the infected liver. Genes up-regulated earlier in the response included T- and B-cell chemoattractants, reflecting the early recruitment of these cells illustrated by flow cytometry. The later phases of the response corresponded with peak recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and myofibroblasts/hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the expression of chemokines with activity for these cells including CCL11 (eotaxin 1), members of the Monocyte-chemoattractant protein family (CCL7, CCL8, CCL12) and the Hepatic Stellate Cell/Fibrocyte chemoattractant CXCL1. Peak expression of macrophage chemoattractants (CCL6, CXCL14) and markers of alternatively-activated macrophages (e.g. Retnla) during this later phase provides further evidence of a role for these cells in schistosome-induced pathology. Additionally, we demonstrate that CCL7 immunolocalises to the fibrotic zone of granulomas. Furthermore, striking up-regulation of neutrophil markers and the localisation of neutrophils and the neutrophil chemokine S100A8 to fibrotic areas suggests the involvement of neutrophils in S. japonicum¬-induced hepatic fibrosis. These results further our understanding of the immunopathogenic and, especially, chemokine signalling pathways that regulate the development of S. japonicum-induced granulomas and fibrosis and may provide correlative insight into the pathogenesis of other chronic inflammatory diseases of the liver where fibrosis is a common feature."'

Found 'E1' in '!Series_summary	"Stimulation of the mouse hindlimb via the sciatic nerve was used to induce contractions for 4 hours to investigate acute muscle gene activation in a model of muscle phenotype conversion. Initial force production (1.6 + 0.1 g/g body weight) declined 45% within 10 min and was maintained for the remainder of the experiment. Force returned to initial levels upon completion of the study.  An immediate-early growth response was present in the EDL (FOS, JUN, ATF3, MAFK) with a similar but attenuated pattern in the soleus.  Transcript profiles showed decreased fast fiber specific mRNA (myosin heavy chains 2A, 2B; troponins T3, I; alpha-tropomyosin, m-creatine kinase) and increased slow transcripts (myosin heavy chain slow/1beta, troponin C, tropomyosin 3gamma) in the EDL.  Histological analysis of the EDL revealed glycogen depletion without inflammatory cell infiltration or myofiber damage in stimulated vs. control muscles. Several fiber type specific transcription factors (EYA1, TEAD1, NFATc1 and c4, PPARG, PPARGC1alpha and beta, BHLHB2) increased in the EDL along with transcription factors characteristic of embryogenesis (KLF4, SOX17, TCF15, PKNOX1, ELAV). No established in vivo satellite cell markers or the genes activated during our parallel studies of satellite cell proliferation in vitro (CYCLINS A2, B2, C, E1, MyoD) increased in the stimulated muscles. These data indicated that onset of fast to slow phenotype conversion occurred in the EDL within 4 hours of stimulation without satellite cell recruitment or muscle injury but was driven by phenotype specific transcription factors from resident fiber myonuclei including activation of nascent developmental transcriptional programs."'

Found 'Acp5' in '!Series_summary	"Children less than 2 years of age are capable of healing large calvarial defects, whereas adults have been found to lack this endogenous ability. In this study, we used microarray analysis to compare genomewide expression patterns during active regeneration after injury with calvaria in skeletally immature and mature mice. Parietal bone defects were created in 6-day-old (juvenile) and 60-day-old (adult) mice using a 4-mm trephine bit (n = 20 mice per age group). The calvarial disc was removed, leaving the underlying dura mater intact. Two weeks after injury, the region of regeneration with the underlying dura mater was harvested, and RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. The 25 most differentially upregulated genes in juvenile regenerates compared with adults were listed, as well as selected bone-related genes. In addition, QRT-PCR confirmation of specific genes was performed for validation. Juvenile regenerates expressed significantly greater amounts of BMP-2, -4, -7, as well as FGF-2 and its receptor FGFR-1. Various other growth factors were also noted to be upregulated, including IGF-2 and Ptn. This corresponded with the increased expression of markers for osteogenic differentiation of Sparc and Oc. Markers of osteoclast activity, Acp5, Ctsk, and Mmp2, were noted to be greater in juvenile regenerates compared with adults. The observation of Mmp14 upregulation, however, highlights the importance of balanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption for ultimate healing. The 2 most differentially regulated genes, transthyretin (Ttr) and prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds), highlight the potential role of retinoic acid signaling and the prostaglandin axis on skeletal regeneration. These findings underscore the multitude of biomolecular mechanisms at play, allowing juvenile calvaria to heal after injury. The identification of various growth factors and cytokines involved also suggests novel therapeutic strategies for tissue-engineering purposes."'

Found 'H3' in '!Series_summary	"CHD7 is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes.  De novo mutation of the CHD7 gene is a major cause of CHARGE syndrome, a genetic disease characterized by a complex constellation of birth defects.  To gain insight to the function of CHD7, we mapped the distribution of the CHD7 protein on chromatin using the approach of chromatin immunoprecipitation on tiled microarrays (ChIP-chip).  These studies were performed in human colorectal carcinoma cells, human neuroblastoma cells, and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells before and after differentiation into neural precursor cells. The results indicate that CHD7 localizes to discrete locations along chromatin that are specific to each cell type, and that the cell-specific binding of CHD7 correlates with a subset of histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me). The CHD7 sites change concomitantly with H3K4me patterns during ES cell differentiation, suggesting that H3K4me is part of the epigenetic signature that defines lineage-specific association of CHD7 with specific sites on chromatin.  Furthermore, the CHD7 sites are predominantly located distal to transcription start sites, most often contained within DNase hypersensitive sites, frequently conserved, and near genes expressed at relatively high levels.  These features are similar to those of gene enhancer elements, raising the possibility that CHD7 functions in enhancer mediated transcription, and that the congenital anomalies in CHARGE syndrome are due to alterations in transcription of tissue-specific genes normally regulated by CHD7 during development."'

Found 'Th2' in '!Series_summary	"DNA-methylation is a vital epigenetic mark that participates in establishing and maintaining chromatin structures and in regulating gene transcription during mammalian development and cellular differentiation. Inter-individual differences in methylation patterns may represent a major source of phenotypic variation, however, the determinants, inheritance, extent, and consequences of such differences are poorly understood. Here we have analysed methylation profiles of immune cells from two inbreed mouse strains (C57BL/6 & BALB/c) that represent prototypic models for Th1- or Th2-dominated immune responses. Using a methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation approach, genomes were fractionated into methylated and unmethylated genome pools and separately analysed at 180 genomic regions (covering 28 Mb of the mouse genome) that were selected based on differential gene expression between both mouse strains. Differentially methylated regions are detected by analyzing array probes for diametrically opposed enrichment behaviour between both hybridizations (e.g. a region that is relatively enriched in the unmethylated pool of BALB/c and shows reverse enrichment behaviour in the methylated pool is considered hypomethylated in BALB/c). The integrated analysis of hypo and hypermethylation profiles allowed the identification of several hundred differentially methylated regions, but also uncovered regions that were duplicated in one strain, contained single nucleotide polymorphisms or micro- and macro-deletions."'

Using a Tamoxifen-inducible CreER system, we show here that sporadic expression of SYT-SSX2 across multiple tissue types leads to exclusive formation of synovial sarcoma-like tumors while its widespread expression is lethal.  CreER-based sporadic expression both avoids the severe early developmental phenotypes     associated with widespread SYT-SSX2 expression and better models natural pathogenesis of cancers where transformed cells usually arise within an environment of largely normal cells."'

Found 'Ptch1' in '!Series_summary	"Medulloblastomas (MBs) are the most common brain tumors in children.  Some are thought to originate from cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) that fail to undergo normal cell cycle exit and differentiation.  Since microRNAs regulate numerous aspects of cellular physiology and development, we reasoned that alterations in miRNA expression might contribute to MB.  We tested this hypothesis using two spontaneous mouse MB models with specific initiating mutations, Ink4c-/-; Ptch1+/- and Ink4c-/-; p53-/-.  We found that 26 miRNAs showed increased expression and 24 miRNAs showed decreased expression in proliferating mouse GNPs and MBs relative to mature mouse cerebellum, regardless of genotype.  Among the 26 overexpressed miRNAs, nine were encoded by the miR-17~92 cluster family, a group of microRNAs implicated as oncogenes in several tumor types.  Analysis of human MBs demonstrated that three miR-17~92 cluster miRNAs (miR-92, miR-19a and miR-20) were also overexpressed in human MBs with a constitutively activated SHH signaling pathway, but not in other forms of the disease.  To test whether the miR-17~92 cluster could promote MB formation, we enforced expression of these miRNAs in GNPs isolated from cerebella of postnatal (P) day P6 Ink4c-/-; Ptch1+/- mice.  These, but not similarly engineered cells from Ink4c-/-; p53-/- mice, formed MBs in orthotopic transplants with complete penetrance.  Interestingly, orthotopic mouse tumors ectopically expressing miR-17~92 lost expression of the wild-type Ptch1 allele.  Our findings suggest a functional collaboration between the miR-17~92 cluster and the SHH signaling pathway in the development of MBs in mouse and man."'

Found 'Scl' in '!Series_summary	"The bHLH transcription factor stem cell leukemia gene (Scl) is a master regulator for hematopoiesis essential for hematopoietic specification and proper differentiation of the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages. However, the critical downstream targets of Scl remain undefined. Here, we identified a novel Scl target gene, transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (Mef2C) from Sclfl/fl fetal liver progenitor cell lines. Analysis of Mef2C-/- embryos showed that Mef2C, in contrast to Scl, is not essential for specification into primitive or definitive hematopoietic lineages. However, adult VavCre+Mef2Cfl/fl mice exhibited platelet defects similar to those observed in Scl deficient mice. The platelet counts were reduced, while platelet size was increased and the platelet shape and granularity was altered. Furthermore, megakaryopoiesis was severely impaired in vitro. ChIP-on-chip analysis revealed that Mef2C is directly regulated by Scl in megakaryocytic cells, but not in erythroid cells. In addition, an Scl independent requirement for Mef2C in B-lymphoid homeostasis was observed in Mef2C-deficient mice, characterized as severe age-dependent reduction of specific B cell progenitor populations reminiscent of premature aging. In summary, this work identifies Mef2C as an integral member of hematopoietic transcription factors with distinct upstream regulatory mechanisms and functional requirements in megakaryocyte and B-lymphoid lineages."'

Genomically, human medulloblastomas were closest to mouse P1-P10 cerebella, and normal human cerebella were closest to mouse P30-P60 cerebella. Furthermore, metastatic MBs were highly associated with mouse P5 cerebella, suggesting that a clinically distinct subset of tumors is identifiable by molecular similarity to a precise developmental stage. Genewise, down- and up-regulated MB genes segregate to late and early stages of development, respectively. Comparable results for human lung cancer vis-a-vis the developing mouse lung suggest the generalizability of this multiscalar developmental perspective on tumor biology.
